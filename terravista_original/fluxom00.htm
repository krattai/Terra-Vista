In this document is current discussions of what Fluxom are, what types there are,
 and how to use them.
<hr>

The question about payment is how does it work?  What is the economy?
This is why I keep going to the Terravi.  I'll change my language to 
say, "Fluxum"  The way I see it, the vHomeOwner might be prepared to 
send me a cheque or I might be able to deal with Credit Cards and 
Debit Cards, long term.  But for now, if they have a certain amount 
of Fluxum in their back pocket, they can transfer the appropriate 
amount of tokens to me and the deal is complete.  (I know, not that 
simple, but this is just the infancy)  I can then take these Fluxum 
and use them for some other purpose.  At some point in time, this 
token should be convertable to IRL cash.  And, there needs to be some 
trustworthy businesses which help track this movement of Fluxum and 
floatsam...  Anyone here ever dreampt about being a banker?  ;-)  But 
joking aside, I'd like to see the economy incorporated being somewhat 
secure.  Sure, I don't mind someone making money off a transaction 
because of the "real" service they give, but the inflationary 
"creating" of money is not something I'd like to see in play.  
Perhaps an isolated system needs to be in place.  655K tokens are put 
into play.  If the two entities are prepared to exchange Fluxum for 
work, then great.  If the "worker" wants cold hard cash, then that 
needs to be negotiated.  Cash does not eqaul Fluxum, in this 
scenario...

~~~~~~~~~~

Along with the Zones I am giving away, I am planning to also give 
about 200 Fluxom.  These Fluxom will be used by the new Zowner in 
exchange for mesh and other objects or beautification.  The way I 
figure it, one Fluxum would be worth about $1.00.  200 Fluxom would 
be worth about 4 hours of my time.  (ie.  I am charging nothing less 
than $50/hour for my VRMLing services).  This is a very real value to 
me.  Some may feel their time is worth more, but for me, I'll be 
happy with 50 Fluxom an hour.

Now, I'll be building things like chairs, couches, bushes, etc, etc, 
etc.  If someone wants a Kevin Rattai exclusive, they would redeem 
those Fluxom for these objects.  If and when they begin to run out, 
or it goes over and above the current amount of Fluxum they have, 
they would then pay the remainder in cash or the would "purchase" 
more fluxom directly, or there are a number of other ways to obtain 
more fluxum, such as doing some work for me, in exchange for Fluxum.

These are the transactions I am looking to generate.  This is how I 
see people getting "used to" a CyberSpace economy.  I will honour all 
the Fluxom I distribute.  If someone else wants to honour my Fluxom, 
that's fine by them.  It has a very real value and I will redeem all 
of them.  And I am prepared to take the risk of potential for 
conterfeit, as I will do everything I can to track my Fluxom.  If 
someone I did not issue Fluxom to, tries to redeem the Fluxom, they 
will have to provide a Fluxom trail to ensure that Fluxom does in 
fact exist in the Fluxom system.

Fluxom are not redeamable for cash.  I will not guarantee the Fluxom. 
 The Fluxom is based on an honour system.  The Fluxom is simply a 
token used to account for transactions.

*heh*  dropped a zero to my benefit...  =)  Yeah, I agree if I can 
re-imberse most of the outstanding Flumox with mesh, then I'm further 
ahead.  I've also determined it's better for me to offer the Fluxom 
only on stuff I personally give out, not on the stuff that is picked 
up off other servers, disks, etc.  And I might give away "specials" 
or "gifts" such as with a random object today, I will give 50 Flumox. 
 Or the first 10 customer requests on Dec. 25 get 100 Fluxom each.  
The other prerogative I have is "cash first, Fluxom second."  
Otherwise, my free time here is exactly that, might as well spend it 
keeping my skills in order...  =)

~ Now  say you act as my agent for my objects e.g. someone pays 50 F for my 
~ mail-box you keep 25 and credit 25 to my Flummox account.

Excellent addition to the program.  Very nice, indeed.  We all start 
working for each other, as well.  All contributing to the big 
picture.  I like that.

~ And I do the same for 
~ anyone in Europe who wants a v.Johannes Apfelsamen worlds and contents  crediting 
~ your Flummox Account. Now we are on the way to establishing real and virtual 
~ international business structures.

Yup, and as these token are returned, we can (as gruen would say) 
"buy 'em, trade 'em, collect 'em all!"  =)  If I have 25 of your 
Fluxom and you have 25 of mine, and instead of working for them, 
decide we have too much else to do, we can exchange them.

~ We can attract some artists as well - a mesh library is a showcase for the skills 
~ of constructors.

I can see this as being a real attractor for the artists as well as 
the general public.  As it was mentioned earlier, getting an 
exclusive, signed "Gwinner Creation", people may start to pay cold, 
hard cash.  But the only way Gwinner will be recognized in a grand 
way might be to participate in a program such as this, by putting his 
mesh on the market.  Very positive.  Win-win-win.

~ Every item will be credited and the artist contactable for 
~ custom work or job offers etc.

Yeah, kinda like having a 1 Fluxom rack, a 100 Fluxum rack, and 
everything in between.  As an aside, earlier on in Terra Vista it was 
also determined that every Zone should have a mail box via which 
visitors could contact the Zowner, and also every vHomeOwner sould 
also have a mailbox on their lot.  Following this line of thought, 
every object could have a "tag" which would bring up details as to 
the Artist, contact information, etc when the pointer is over the 
object.  Just thoughts...

~~~~~~~

~ that you could 'brand' a fluxum with 'your' ID;

well...  I was thinking of this at first, then realized the potential 
for conterfeit...  the solution I saw to this is in a bit...

~ thus some fluxom would be
~ worth more than others.

For this (forgot to mention, sorry), the concept is all Fluxom are 
equal.  That's the bit about I'm OK with 50 Fluxom/hour, someone else 
might want 100.  But they are equal, across the board, no matter who 
issues them.  We need a consistancy both for ourselves and for the 
customer.

~  This might actually cause some minor currency
~ problems: nobody would want to spend the really cool coins <G>.  

This was interesting, though...  Again, I thought of actually 
"creating" the coins and again thought better of it due to 
conterfeit, as well as concepts like a document with Fluxom number 
ranges...  It all increases the likelyhood of conterfeit and abuse.  
So, I'm simply thinking of this.  Right now a manual system, in the 
future an automated system, or perhaps there will be a point where it 
will be converted to a different system or picked up by e-cash, or 
something.

Since the transfer of Fluxom will not include any actual object, 
except perhaps documentation, then the need for a locked object falls 
outside of this...

~   I'd really like to do something like that, but it's GOT to be secure.

I do agree with the security issue in some ways.  I'm open to 
discussing this as we move along, and feel we should take a look at a 
lot of different options to find a best fit.  For now, we might 
simply go with the non-transferable Fluxom issued independantly to 
those customers you can "trust."  And if someone offers me Fluxom 
they claimed were issued by Andrew, I would cross reference with him 
to ensure a valid claim and allow him to make the appropriate 
calculations.

~ 'hand' people tokens.  It's a cool idea.  I think the idea of having
~ different kinds of currency would be cool too.

Yup, I really see a benefit to having some kind of currency system in 
place.  Perhaps we could even implement the basic vFluxom, 
create 1million tokens, and start distributing them amongst the 
population.  This is used between them, this does not concern any 
transactions for actual content from authors/artists/whatever.  If 
they want to pay each other to exchange objects, they can use the 
vFluxom.  The dFluxom is a documented Fluxom.  These are used 
specifically for transactions between Zowners, vHomowners, etc, and 
the authors/artists/whatever.  a vFluxom is an "id'd", numbered, 
whatever object, within the wrls, a dFluxom is documented and 
non-transferable between vCitizens.  Once we can find a better way to 
secure the dFluxom as an object, numbered, with a number of other 
protective measures, than we can distribute them as well.
