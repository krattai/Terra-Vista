<STRONG>Garson</STRONG> provides the world with excellent quality
 limestone.  I suspect the locals wonder why it is called
 <A HREF="tyndall.htm">Tyndall</A> stone.  The old quarries are
 a popular swimming hole for some of the braver locals.  Fed
 by artesian wells, the water probably doesn't get much warmer
 than extremely cold.  Garson is located 8 miles west of
 Beausejour on highway 44.
