<H2>Brokenhead (what's in a name)</H2>
  The namesake
 river flows through the municipality, north past Libau and
 feeds into Lake Winnipeg.  It is excellent for many species
 of fish including Northern Pike and Walleye.  Of course,
 the spring run of Suckers is awaited by the impatient
 locals who enjoy the tendor meat fresh from their smoke
 houses.<P>
The flood planes of the river have made it a perfect agricultural
 area.  The soil ranges from a sandy loam to heavy clay loam
 to an organic mass which is highly nutrient and biologically
 rich.  All cereal crops and many oil seeds are in their
 perfect climate along the "banana belt", as it is affectionately
 known by the locals.  Some vegetable production such as sugar
 beets are grown here, though these are not typical crops.
  Forage crops such as alfalfa and trefoil are popular as are
 some grasses such as timothy and canary seed.  Some areas
 such as around Tyndall and Garson are more suited to pasture
 use due to the high sand and gravel content, though that is
 not to say that with a little sweat and determination, the
 rocks stop growing and you can produce quality crops.  Dairy,
 beef, and swine production thrives in the area.  There
 are also a few producers of poultry (especially the Hutterite
 Colonies).
<P>
Winter and Summer, the area is a playground.  I suspect that
 the area boasts a 1.5:1 snowmobile to human population.  Every
 winter discussion includes where people went "sledding" or
 whether they are going to a poker derby or ice fishing or
 just cruising for the evening.  Also known as a haven for
 four wheel drive trucks, the goal of many teenagers is to
 build the tallest, ultimate truck.  The proof of transition
 to adulthood is gaged on how far you make it through the ditch
 or mud hole, without getting stuck.  Of course, whether you
 own a "sled" or not, you also have a high likelyhood of
 having a "quad", "tryke", or "bike" (or two) in the back
 yard or garage.  The enterprising person is the one who
 is able to convert their "sled" to a "quad" for the summer.
  Ah, yes.  The person who does not have a battle wound or
 story to tell you about their "riding" experience is a
 lonely person indeed, around Brokenhead.
