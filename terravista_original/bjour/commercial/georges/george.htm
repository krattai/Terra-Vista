The food at <B>George's</B> (I must profess) is some of the best I've had in
 Beausejour.  The burgers, dogs, and fries are excellent.  What I would
 recommend is have all three served up with the home made chili.  If you
 are more likely to eat something more healthy the Submarines and Salads might
 be what you are after.  Breakfast and Sandwiches are also on the menu.
  If you would really like to treat yourself, you can't do better than
 a Pizza from George's, and if you order after 2:00pm, you can take
 advantage of the two for one prices.  Come in and fulfill your hunger,
 seven days a week.

If you are looking for a licenced, social environment, then <B>Steve's
 Sports Bar</B> is where you want to be.  Sporting paraphrenalia hanging from
 the walls (in fact, I don't think I know what the walls even look like)
 and three television screens will hold your attention.  As well, Steve's
 offers up a pool table, shuffle board, and dart boards for those who
 enjoy playing.  Come in, sit down, and make like a local at Steve's
 Sports Bar.  Perhaps you will be able to catch a band playing on the
 weekend.
