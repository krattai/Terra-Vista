<STRONG>Beausejour</STRONG> is a beautiful agricultural community
 situated a mere 1 hour from Winnipeg, east on highway 44.  It is a
 gateway to the Whiteshell Provincial Park and the Canadian Shield.
  A very social town, it has activities for both young and old alike,
 and recreational possibilities spaning all four seasons.
