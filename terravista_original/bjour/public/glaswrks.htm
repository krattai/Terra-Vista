<H2>Glass Works Factory</H2>
South of Park Avenue on First street<BR>
<P>
The Glass Works factory is an historical remnant of Beausejour.
  Before becoming a private owned
 <A HREF="../commercial/sands/sands00.htm">beach</A>
 resort, the sand was used to make glass.  The history is best told
 accurately, though I can mention a few things right now.  The building
 and equipment have been dismantled and removed.  The foundation still
 exists and has been turned into a Manitoban Historical site.  It is
 touch oriented and a perfect journey for Manitoba history seekers.
  The sand was removed from a pit nearby and used to make a classic
 green glass, molded mainly into jars and bottles.  After the Glass
 Works closed down, a Winnipeg company purchased the rights to the
 sand pit and began pumping the sand and water out of the pit,
 sifting out the sand, and hauling it away for processing.  This
 was the time when many of the local sandboxes became filled with this
 much coveted mineral.  I am well aware of the quality of slump the
 sand provides and it is perfect for sand castles.  The (then) owner
 was asked to stop the removal of sand as it became a concern that
 the nearby Hospital's foundation was being affected by the removal
 of the supporting ground.  After many years of dormancy, the pit
 was purchased by enterprising locals, and converted into a resort,
 as it stands now.
