Subject: Beausejour

Y'know, I used to say that best thing about Beausejour was the highway 
leading out of it! Now the information superhighway leads into 
Beausejour. I'd never have "thunk" it!

After leaving BJ I became a radio gypsy, landing (for a time) at CITI-FM 
in Winnipeg. Now I'm at 100.3 The Q in gorgeous Victoria BC. But every 
year it seems I make it back, drive down the main drag, swing by the old 
school(s)...

Now I can visit whenever I want.

Thank you..
