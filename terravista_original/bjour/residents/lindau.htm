Subject:          Hi from Sunny Florida

Hey Kevin,
I guess if I had to think of the first person from Bjour I'd find on the 
Net it would be you.  Cool home page!!!  If I'm ever lonely for good old 
Beausejour I now know where to turn.  
I actually ended up here looking for the name of the Bjour travel agent. 
I never really expected to find anyone.  

Don't know if you ever seen Kevin & Andy anymore but if you see em say Hi 
for me.  Well I gotta continue my search but good talking to ya!!!

Hey lots of good jobs down here if you ever get the urge to head south, 
drop me a line.  

See ya,
Linda
