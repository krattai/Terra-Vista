It's good to see that the old town is moving into the information age. As most
everyone I used to hang out with has left our great town, this will be a useful
way to keep in touch and find out what's happening at E.S.S., Chicken Delight,
the pits, etc.<p>

As for myself, it's been over 13 years since I left Beausejour and 7 years
since I left Manitoba. I lived for a couple years in Kingston, Ontario, doing
my doctorate in economic history at Queen's. I was also in Malawi Africa for
about a year and in Edinburgh and London in the UK for about a year as well
doing research. In the summer of 1994 I took a French immersion course in La
Pocatiere, Quebec which was a great experience. Right now, I teach African 
history at Trent University in Peterborough, Ontario. <p>

Next year, I don't know. I have itchy feet and what to do some more travelling.
I may stay on here next year, or I might go back to Quebec or I might even go
to South Korea or Japan for a year. It all depends on what turns up and how I
feel. <p>

Some other former Beausejourites and where they are:<p>

MILES KELLER:<p>

He's been up in Poplar River in northern Manitoba teaching. He is married (poor
guy). I think he's been up there 7 or eight years. The last I heard, though, he
and his wife are thinking of looking for a change. Teaching English in Asia is
a possibility.<p>

BOB HASTMAN:<p>

He's some kind of hi-tech computer guy (technical analyst?) with BC Systems in
Victoria, B.C. He seems to like the warm weather and looks likely to remain
where he is for some time.<p>

BERNIE PLESKACZ:<p>

He's living in Toronto. I saw him while I was there last year a few times. He
was playing in some weird band called "Polyester Explosion" and in some bizarre
one man show called "Locust Eater." I saw Polyester Explosion and they were
quite good. Maybe he'll make it as a rock star some day.<p>

HUGH PHILLIPS:<p>

He's also living in Toronto. I ran into him by chance on Bloor St. He works at
a daycare and has two kids. Hugh's claim to fame is that he plays bass for the
John Wiseman Band. If you haven't heard of John Wiseman, he is a member of Blue
Rodeo. If you haven't heard of Blue Rodeo, well, I can't help you.<p>

MARTIN BAXTER:<p>

He was out in BC or Alberta working on a stable or something the last I heard.
He finished his BA at U of Winnipeg a year or two ago. He was thinking of doing
an MA in philosophy. The last I heard from my source Bob Hastman, Martin was
thinking of heading out to Asia to teach English. Hey, maybe we could have a
Beausejour reunion out in Asia!<p>

Well, that sums up everything I know. I hope to hear more about what everyone
else in our great metropolis is doing or what great things everyone has moved
on to.<p>

Cheers,<p>
