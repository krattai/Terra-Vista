	Anything is everything and more.  Everything is reality as we know it today, anything is Terra 
Vista.  So we begin our journey through Terra Vista, from its early beginnings in the minds of  a few select 
people around the world, to its roots deep in science fiction, to early prototype worlds which offered 
glimpses of the near future, to the virtual worlds now being created and changing our lives forever.
<P>
	This project has advanced so far so fast that its hard to remember how and when it actually started.  
To find its origins we must go back to one solitary post by George Philippakos.  In that message he asked 
for everyone on the www-vrml@wired.com mailing list to form a "joint VRML community project".  In 
this project we would create seamlessly interconnecting worlds in which visitors to this world could meet 
and interact with each other much more realistically than with any other technology on the Net.  This 
proposal obviously generated vast amounts of interest within the VRML community but it could be said 
that it was not until Kevin Rattai joined George with this project and formed a separate virtual community 
for this topic alone.  Then this project took off like an Eggo in a toaster.
<P>
	Day after day more people were joining, each with their own visions of what would soon be Terra 
Vista.  By this point ideas were flying and members of the community were soon receiving in excess of 70 
messages a day, needless to say we had our share of mail server crashes and members were seeing just how 
good their email software actually was.
<P>
	As with many other technologies Terra Vista was partly inspired by some of the great science 
fiction writings of our time.  Most notably William Gibson's "Neuromancer" and Neal Stephenson's "Snow 
Crash" which brought us Cyberspace and The Metaverse respectively.  Gibson forever changed people's 
perception of computer technology and many years from now he will most certainly be remembered as one 
of this centuries greatest visionaries.  With these images forever embedded in our minds we set forth to 
create this massive virtual community that would span the globe, something that even now is not fully 
explainable, or imaginable.
<P>
	Now I should note that up to this point we still did not have a name and were simply referring to 
ourselves as the Virtual Community project, so it was decided  that we would vote on a name and asked for 
suggestions on names to vote from, and within a few days we had more than 60 names to choose from.  
After all the votes were tallied the name was chosen, Terra Vista.  Yours truly originally suggested the 
"Vista" part which is Spanish for "a mental view into the distant past or future", and Justin Couch added 
"Terra", Latin for "land of".  Combined we created a name which we will forever be identified with and one 
that you might be hearing a lot about in the near future.
<P>
	Now things were falling together, we had a name, were well organized and most importantly were 
retaining our original ideas.  We even had some corporate interest in our project.  Much of this interest was 
generated from our prototype worlds.  Worlds where our ideas and concepts were being used and actually 
worked.  It was then when we realized we were truly creating something, something big, something 
unimaginable until now.
<P>
	OK, enough with the history lesson.  Lets get into the real reason I'm writing this essay, to share 
our vision with you so you can fully comprehend what Terra Vista is and why we did it.
<P>
	For those who are not at all familiar with the project I'll start with the basics.  Terra Vista is a vast 
expanse of virtual worlds and homes interlinked seamlessly across the Internet.  One analogy is a big game 
of multiplayer Doom where anything is possible, another would be your imagination.  Anything you can 
imagine could be a part of Terra Vista, either now or in the near future.
<P>
	Now for the small bit of technical stuff.  Terra Vista is now possible because of a technology called 
VRML (or Virtual Reality Modeling Language).  VRML allows for realistic worlds to be created and placed 
on the Internet for anyone to "walk" or "fly" through.  This technology combined with a little ingenuity on 
the part of the members and we have a true virtual community.
<P>
	When you first hear "virtual community" you probably think of a small place, a town or village, 
which is why we voted to change the name to Terra Vista as I described before.  Terra Vista will not be a 
small place, rather it will be a vast space of interlinking homes and worlds.  There will also be cities and 
villages within Terra Vista or anything else you want to create.  Having your own "home" in Terra Vista will 
be like having your own homepage today.  If you like golf you could design your own virtual golf course 
tell anyone in the world about it, or if you like space exploration you could tour the universe with a few 
close friends in your own virtual space ship, or anything else you can imagine.
<P>
	As the technology advances we will see many more possibilities like a virtual mall where you could 
walk around and pick up realistic looking objects and place them in you virtual shopping cart or on-line 
games as good as CD-ROM based games, or real-time video conferncing.  But even now Terra Vista is an 
amazing place, far more advanced than anything else on the Net.
<P>
	Everything I've mentioned so far has been mostly for entertainment but there as just as many 
educational or business related uses of Terra Vista.  For instance schools could use Terra Vista to journey 
though Egypt and learn about the Pyramids with a virtual tour guide who actually is in Egypt, or take a tour 
of the White House, or anything else they are learning in school.  Small businesses could put their stores in 
Terra Vista, or large companies could have entire buildings where users could talk to company 
representatives and buy their products.  Or perhaps more ambitious companies could have their own 
planets.  
<P>
	And of course there will be meeting places, virtual cafes, maybe even movie theaters or universities 
with real-time video and audio.  Which brings us to another part of Terra Vista, interaction, you can interact 
with everything and everyone you see in any given world.  Without interaction Terra Vista wouldn't be half 
of what it is today, interaction is everything in Terra Vista.  If you're in a museum and see a sculpture you 
like you could pick it up to examine it or hide it under your coat and walk out :-), or if your skiing you could 
make a snowball and throw it at the skier next to you, although they probably wouldn't appreciate that very 
much and considering that the other skier could push a tree down on top of you it might not be such a good 
idea.
<P>
	In conclusion Terra Vista like all other technologies will grow beyond our imaginations, maybe 
you'll be browsing Terra Vista will a VR headset and gloves or maybe not but either way there will be 
interaction, imagination, and entertainment.  This is our vision and we invite everyone to experience this for 
themselves.
