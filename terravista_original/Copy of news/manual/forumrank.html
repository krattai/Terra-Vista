<br><br>
With Forum Ranking System you can add, delete or modify user ranks
which will show in your forum.<br><br>

There are two type of ranking system:<br>
<u>Global ranks</u><br>
Will appear after user post a number of post. For example you create
a new rank called "New User" so after his or her post past a maximum number
then he or she will get a new ranks.<br><br>

<u>Special ranks</u><br>
Will always assign to the user. So no matter what is his or her post,
he or she will have the ranks.<br><br>

When you create a new ranks, once you click on "special" then the ranks
will assign min post as "-1" and max post as "-1". This way you should
not worried about posting a minimum or maximum post.<br><br>

P.S.: Please make sure after you create a special rank you also assign the
new rank into that user by editing his or her profile using user admin.<br><br>
