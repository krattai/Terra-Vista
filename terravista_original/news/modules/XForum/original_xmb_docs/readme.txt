----------#--- XMB README ---#----------

XMB (Extreme Message Board) is a very proud project of mine. Plans for this
baby have been running through my mind since November 2000, but it was
not until January 2001 (Jan 17th, to be exact) that I took action. But I don't wish
to bore you with a drawn out story of how I exactly developed this, that is of no
interest to you. So instead, I bring you XMB. Enjoy!



Installation:
1. Open up config.php (Notepad will do) and find the 4 variables at the top ($dbname, 
$dbuser, $dbpw, $dbhost). Edit these so that they match the settings for your host. Also,
new in 1. 0 Final is the $tablepre variable. This allows you to set a prefix for the name of
each table so you can install multiple instances of XMB on the same database.


2. Upload everything, retaining the original structure of the files. Everything thing should 
be in ASCII except the images/ content (binary).


3. Once everything is uploaded, chmod settings.php to 766


4. Then, run the install script . To do this, just visit www.yourdomain.com/boarddir/install.php.
The script will automatically install it.


5. Go to your boards and register. It will automatically make you an admin.


6. Visit the control panel (the link will be visible once your logged in) and change stuff. Enjoy!
