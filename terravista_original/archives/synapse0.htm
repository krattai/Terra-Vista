SynapsetV has gone through some changes and is pleased to announce
 a continuum of life.
<p>
We are entering a new millennia!  As we do so, our technologies for 
social interaction and interaction with the machine get better along 
the way.  We now have many products and technologies for 
participating in workgroups from remote locations, one of which is 
known as VRML and uses the internet as its backbone.  SynapsetV is 
not intended to focus on any one tool or function, but is set out to 
give anyone a voice for where they see these technologies leading us. 
 Virtual Reality is not quite available to the general public, but 
through the use of VRML for the SynapsetV events, the general public 
can at last experience what the future holds in store.
<P>
A rotation of events will take place in the SynapsetV forum
 on a fairly regular basis.  At this time, no events are
 scheduled.  As events begin to take place, they will be
 listed here on this page.
<P>
Unfortunately, one of the events which was to take place
 on December 7, 1996 has been postponed until further notice.
  I do appologize of any inconvenience this may have caused
 anyone.
<p>
We are currently looking for more content for the events in the form 
of topics for presentation or for panel discussion.  If you would 
like to do a presentation or would like to participate in a panel, 
please contact me to discuss this further.  Also, we would like to 
have a number of physical groups to get together.  Locally in 
Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada we will be holding a physical group 
participation for demonstrations and would like to invite other groups to 
join in a similar fashion.
<P>
For further information and to discuss participation, please contact 
me via email response.
<P>
Thank you,
<P>
