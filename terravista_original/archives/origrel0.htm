ANN:  Terra Vista VRML Awards Ceremony

For immediate release
August 9, 1996
Terra Vista Central

I am pleased to release the restricted announcement of the "Terra
Vista VRML Awards Ceremony" which will take place on November 30th,
1996 (tentative).  The ceremony will take place on the internet in
general on the Terra Vista mailing list and will be simulcast in a
VRML multi user enabled environment for those who are able and wish to
partake the ceremonies in this manner.  The ceremonies are intended to
commemorate those who have helped VRML become what it is to date and
are striving to create what it will be in the future.  It will offer
recognition to those who provide compelling and interesting
environments on the internet using VRML.

Nominees come in two forms, self nomination and third party 
nomination (ie.  I might nominate someone else's work).  The Awards
offered will come in three major categories of: Pure VRML, Combinations
(including frames, Java(script), extension nodes), and Non-VRML worlds
(proprietary software or other 3D worlds)

Some Sub-categories are (but not limited to):
Pure VRML:
  Best VRML 1.0 world
  Best VRML 2.0 world
  Fastest loader:
      non-compressed
      compressed
  Best effects (use of lighting, colouring, etc)
  Most compelling content (Theme based, content well laid out)
  Most entertaining (Sites you want to go back to regularly)

Other categories to be mentioned later.

Guest speakers (TBA) will include movers and shakers in the industry,
founders of Terra Vista, technology futurists, and others.  The 
event will include the location of the URL which will house the
links to all the nominated works and will again be multi-user enabled
for those who wish to use it.  As well as the main stage where the
awards will be presented.

Nominations will be accepted up to November 10, 1996.  Worlds _must_
be completed by November 20th.  Please note:  If you intend to
self-nominate, please submit your nomination by October 1, 1996.
