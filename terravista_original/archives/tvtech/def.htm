<p>
<strong>Zone:</strong> a VRML space with a common theme and aesthetic (even the
theme of no-theme) with a defined volume and which abuts other
zones via matching borders.
<p>
<strong>Segment:</strong> a subdivision of a zone.  Segments are small enough to
be comfortably loaded in a reasonable time on "typical" VRML
browsing machines.  They are connected to other segments in the
same zone (or to other zone's segments if they are border segments).
<p>
<strong>Static vs. CGI world generation:</strong>  chief difference, from browser's
perspective, is that CGI allows dynamic definition of the segment size
and borders (browser user decides what size chunks to load).  Static
worlds have fixed segment sizes.
<p>
<strong>Home:</strong> a VRML file provided as an inline to a segment by the
"inhabitant" of a zone.  The Home resides on the inhabitant's server
and must meet certain requirements determined by VCP and Zoning Rules.
<p>
<strong>VCP:</strong> Virtual Community Protocols.  These are the set of rules that
all zones (and all they contain) must abide by in order to permit the
community to exist and be browsable.  Example VCP rules: VRML 1.0 or
compatible standards only.  Contiguous borders between zones (should be
able to quilt together).  Top level rules, mainly technical.
<p>
<strong>Zoning Rules:</strong>  These are the set of rules that apply within a zone only.  They
tend to be aesthetic in nature and are determined by whatever authority is
created or accepted by the zone.  These are the Home Rule rules and do not
apply outside the zone.
