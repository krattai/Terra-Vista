<h2>VRML Tutorials Prototype</h2>

<p>
<hr width="100%" >This is a prototype format for VRML tutorials. It uses
three frames, but is also available in a non-frame format. People would
access the tutorials from a menu list (similar to this one) or from who-knows-where
else--anywhere it makes sense to place such a link. <b>Humongous and Many
Thanks</b> are due to Jeff Sonstein for showing so many of us how to do
this and for providing useful examples and inspiration.</p>

<h3>Tutorials Menu</h3>

<p>I recommend that the tutorials be accessed (although not exclusively)
through a simple menu. This menu should be further organized in outline
form, although this will only become necessary if many tutorials come to
exist. A second option would be to create multiple levels of menus that
serve different types of tutorials. I recommend avoiding this option until
the volume or complexity of the tutorials requires it, as it adds navigational
complexity to the system where none is needed. We should try to avoid building
fences between the user and what they need to know. At first, the menu
would be a simple bulleted list, like . . .</p>

<p>Menu:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="tutframe.htm">Example Tutorial</a></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="tutorexn.htm">Non-frame Example Tutorial</a>
<br></li>

<li>List would continue here. More to come. . . .</li>
</ul>

<p>Click on the example link above to see the frame based example of the
tutorial design.</p>

<h3>How The Tutorial Works:</h3>

<p>Prerequisites for Construction:</p>

<ul>
<li>You should already know HTML well enough to create a frameset page
and write targeted links (or be willing to examine the example source and
learn.)</li>

<li>You should also be able to create a simple menu with links to bookmarks
in the tutorial file.</li>
</ul>

<p>Check the document source of the examples to see how I did these things.</p>

<p>Each tutorial requires a minimum of 4 files:</p>

<ol>
<li>The framesetting file which breaks the screen up into three frames
and loads three other files.</li>

<li>The VRML world file, which loads into the upper left frame. There could
be more than one world file, as each step in the tutorial could be shown
in VRML form.</li>

<li>The tutorial HTML file, which loads into the upper right frame. For
now, let's limit this to a single file.</li>

<li>The plain text versions of the example VRML code round out the set
and appear in the bottom frame of the screen. A plain text file could (and
perhaps should) exist for each VRML world example.</li>
</ol>

<p>A link to the tutorial loads the framesetting file. This file, in turn,
loads the other files. Using targeted links in the tutorial, the student
can load worlds and code text for each step.</p>

<p>For example, say I've got a tutorial that has three important steps
and I want to show the student what they should see at each step. Here's
what I'd recommend.</p>

<ul>
<li>On entry to the tutorial, load the finished object and finished object
code into the respective windows. If the student does not want or need
to see intermediate progress examples, they can see the completed versions
throughout the tutorial.</li>

<li>Provide targeted links to intermediate examples in the appropriate
place in the tutorial. To the best of my knowledge, two links are required,
one to load the sample world in the world window, one for the sample code
in the code window.</li>

<li>Provide a menu at the top of the tutorial somewhere that organizes
the lesson into basic steps. This serves as an advanced organizer that
lays out lesson structure for the student and gives them the big picture
framework for the upcoming activities. It also makes a handy menu for quickly
finding any single point.</li>

<li>Include links to the finished world and code in the advanced organizer
at the top.</li>

<li>Non Frame Versions are basically the same files as the frame versions,
accessed through a different menu which avoids the framesetting file. You
should use the NOFRAMES section of the framesetting document to serve the
same function, as the example does. One important exception: if you are
using targeted anchors in your tutorial, you should produce a non-frames
version with non-targeted anchors.</li>
</ul>
