If there is to be a marketplace in these virtual communities, there
 will need to be some sort of Economic Structure.  Although I am
 partial to a Parity Economics structure, the following are some
 thoughts on how we might go upon creating this marketplace.
<hr>
<pre>
go get a copy of the
Aug issue. There is a short but powerful article in there on e-commerce
and the main premise is that "Community precedes Commerce". The world is
waking up and it would really be cool if we were there to serve
breakfast :-)

~~~~~~~

  Don't forget my concept of "Locked Avatars".  Unlocking some avatars for
use involves exchanging e-cash.  I was going to do it on CompuSeve through
the 'SWREG' feature (ShareWare Reg: you punch in a code number associated
with each piece of shareware you want to buy, review the charges and make
sure it's the right software, then CompuServe pays the developer from your
online charges.  Nice :-).

  However, with the Internet I'd need some form of e-cash anyway.

~~~~~~~

A basic world should be free - the customer can choose from a few off the peg 
models

charges come for 
 -maintaining and updating - regular renovating
 - extras 
 -custom made worlds price dependant on coding time IndexedFaceSets, Extrusions, 
  textures cost more than Boxes
 -the choice of designer would also be a factor
 -animation
 -zoning -  let market forces decide - popular zones should cost money to join.
 -zones could be traded

 then comes custom built avatars, avatar fashion ........

~~~~~~~

Advertisers will go to places where there are 
1) lots of hits - back to the counters for wrls theme of a few weeks ago I'd 
really like to set one up on flux so we can follow TV growth (for the record I am 
against ads in Flux but relaxed about any other part of TV/EM/HW/V.city)

2) opportunities to selectivly advertise. This is  where the Terra Vista zones 
can be used in a big way. If I was selling fishing tackle and there was a zone of 
fly fishing worlds I would be interested. etc.

~~~~~~~~~~

But, in one case, we (meaning I; I don't expect people to do this) 
would build a vHome.  A pre-fab jobber with the only real variation 
being maybe color scheme.  Then, if the person wants to start 
sprucing their vHome up, they would pay (?) $2.00 for a stucco 
texture, $5.00 for a mexican tile roof, $10.00 for a pool and $20.00 
for a rail or white picket fence.

Oh, yeah...  a chair is $3.00 a couch is $5.00 a fouton...?  well...  
it depends on how fluffy you want it and how many polygons it needs 
to be...  ;-)

I think I'd have to see a prototype before I could make a
definitive judgement call on that one! (Certainly I don't doubt your
expertise, I just have never seen a virtual home before! Don't know what
it'll be like) If it's a one-time-cost (as opposed to monthly) I'm
thinking you could easily charge $20...

> comfortable to pay.  The other option might be charging $5.00 to put
> an extra floor on your vHome, $2.00 for a couch for inside, etc,

Oh, I definitely think the more features chosen, the more expensive it
should be... and they could upgrade when they felt like spiffing it up a
little!

> etc...  In time people can make their own, if they learn how to VRML?

It would be too cool if there was an interface that allowed the
"resident" to, say, change the carpet color at will, paint the walls a
new color, or re-arrange the furniture... start a fire in the
fireplace... plant new flowers in the window boxes...

~~~~~~~~~~

GeorgeTown and Downtown also belong to Terra Vista but are open to advertising! 

Any way both George Town and Down Town can provide advertising revenue for TV and 
for the maintainers. Down Town is straightforward - 
all advertising is paid for. George Town, by it's nature, allows free advertising 
on the lots but the (yet to be designed) trasport system is under our control.

Terra Vista zones and worlds are the property of  the Zoners and revenues go to 
them.

~~~~~~~~~~

~ It seems to me ths issue here is strictly one of timecost, what the buyer is
~ willing to spend, and what the seller is willing to accept.

Yes, I'd agree.  I believe your issues with this are the same as some 
of the concerns I have.  How do you determine the timecost?  IOW, 
Fred, just out of college has every idea on the teories of how to do 
it, but has never done it so takes 10 times longer because he's in 
his head worrying about doing a flow chart before starting to work.  
Whereas someone experienced need not have to do this.  Who spends 
longer?  Who provides "better" (subjective, I know) content?  How can 
you equivilate (new word made up by me!) the two?  Should that take 
away from any "effort" by the one who put in lots of effort, blood, 
sweat and tears, yet didn't quite "make the grade"?

~ In the vCity novel, I postulated that "the corporation" made very basic
~ pre-fabricated structures available to people which they, themselves,
~ could modify if they pleased.

This is the way I see it happening.  Create a base class of vHomes 
and then it's a pay per feature after that.  There's a spin, 
though...  I'll add in a bit...

~ industry of VRML designers who were paid cash on the barrel-head to
~ hand-custom fancier sites.

Commercial clientelle...  I'd believe...

~ If I remember correctly I pegged the cost of a nice site at $500 U.S.

Nice?  I hate when people ask me to quantify, but how would you 
define "nice"?  What if we were to say someone's being paid $25/hour 
which would be about the $50K we've discussed at Eminds.  A straight 
pay per labour would mean it should take about... 20hours to create a 
"nice" site?  So because we try to do a 1:1 or 1:1:1 disbursement of 
cash revenues, then it should take between 7 hours (let's say a day) 
and 10 hours (day and a half), with nose to grindstone, to create a 
"nice" site, and this doesn't take into consideration experience 
level and available resources to draw from (ie: prefab forms for 
constructing chimneys or spiral staircases, or whatever)  This is the 
"mesh" that will come in handy, in a big way, down the future.

~ I think the real money to be made will be with corporate accounts,
~ not for residences.

Economies of scale.  Lots of the small stuff or a few of the big 
stuff.  Less of the latter, more of the former...  Not right now, 
long term...  (anyone for doing up a cobweb theory matrix?  ;-)

~  As usual.  But again, it all depends upon what
~ the customer wants to use a VRML model *for*.  Marketing tool?
~ Tourist attraction?  Technology testbed? virtual Theatre?

Good questions...  Determine the value to the customer to generate 
the cost of the project...  I've always seen danger in the principal, 
similar to gouging, but in the same token the "buyer" pays depending 
on how bad the buyer "wants".

~ If terra vista wants to establish a virtual currency, may I suggest
~ the "fluxum"?  And if a VRML designer is stiffed on his invoice, he
~ can then be "flummoxed".

~~~~~~~~~~~~

These "people", these "vHomOwners"...  They're going to want to 
upgrade their vHomes.  Two things to do before even starting.  Learn 
VRML at home or take a course in it somewhere.  TelliUniversity 
sounds like a good place to me.  =)  Are we ready to take on clients? 
 Anyhow, there's a potential to make revenue there, in training.  At 
this time, the vHomeOwner can start adding.  They know how to add 
mass to the structure, but they may not want to build that fancy 
marble stairwell.  So, they go to the local vHomevHardwarez and pick 
out just the right texture and framework.  More potential for the 
mesh makers...  Once the vHomeOwner sees what needs to be done, they 
may decide they don't want to do it themselves, so they decide to get 
a contractor to do it for them...  More potential revenue...

The question about payment is how does it work?  What is the econmoy?
This is why I keep going to the Terravi.  I'll change my language to 
say, "Fluxum"  The way I see it, the vHomeOwner might be prepared to 
send me a cheque or I might be able to deal with Credit Cards and 
Debit Cards, long term.  But for now, if they have a certain amount 
of Fluxum in their back pocket, they can transfer the appropriate 
amount of tokens to me and the deal is complete.  (I know, not that 
simple, but this is just the infancy)  I can then take these Fluxum 
and use them for some other purpose.  At some point in time, this 
token should be convertable to IRL cash.  And, there needs to be some 
trustworthy businesses which help track this movement of Fluxum and 
floatsam...  Anyone here ever dreampt about being a banker?  ;-)  But 
joking aside, I'd like to see the economy incorporated being somewhat 
secure.  Sure, I don't mind someone making money off a transaction 
because of the "real" service they give, but the inflationary 
"creating" of money is not something I'd like to see in play.  
Perhaps an isolated system needs to be in place.  655K tokens are put 
into play.  If the two entities are prepared to exchange Fluxum for 
work, then great.  If the "worker" wants cold hard cash, then that 
needs to be negotiated.  Cash does not eqaul Fluxum, in this 
scenario...
