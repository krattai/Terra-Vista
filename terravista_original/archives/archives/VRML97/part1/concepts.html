<H3><A NAME="4.1.3"></A>4.1.3 Conventions used</H3>

<P>The following conventions are used throughout this part of ISO/IEC 14772:</P>

<P><I>Italics</I> are used for event and field names, and are also used
when new terms are introduced and equation variables are referenced.</P>

<P>A <CODE>fixed-space</CODE> font is used for URL addresses and source
code examples. ISO/IEC 14772 UTF-8 encoding examples appear in <B><CODE>bold,</CODE>
<CODE>fixed-space</CODE></B> font.</P>

<P>Node type names are appropriately capitalized (e.g., &quot;The Billboard
node is a grouping node...&quot;). However, the concept of the node is often
referred to in lower case in order to refer to the semantics of the node,
not the node itself (e.g.,&nbsp;&quot;To rotate the billboard...&quot;).</P>

<P>The form &quot;0xhh&quot; expresses a byte as a hexadecimal number representing
the bit configuration for that byte.</P>

<P>Throughout this part of ISO/IEC 14772, references are denoted using the
&quot;x.[ABCD]&quot; notation, where &quot;x&quot; denotes which clause
or annex the reference is described in and &quot;[ABCD]&quot; is an abbreviation
of the reference title. For example, 2.[ABCD] refers to a reference described
in clause 2 and E.[ABCD] refers to a reference described in annex E.</P>

<H3><A NAME="4.2.1"></A>4.2.1 The structure of a VRML file</H3>

<P>A <I>VRML file</I> consists of the following major functional components:
the header, the <I>scene graph</I>, the prototypes, and <I>event</I> <I>routing</I>.
The contents of this file are processed for presentation and interaction
by a program known as a <I>browser</I>.</P>

<H3><A NAME="4.2.2"></A>4.2.2 Header</H3>

<P>For easy identification of VRML files, every VRML file shall begin with:</P>

<PRE><B>#VRML V2.0 </B>&lt;encoding type&gt;<B> </B>[optional comment]<B> </B>&lt;line terminator&gt;</PRE>

<P>The header is a single line of UTF-8 text identifying the file as a VRML
file and identifying the encoding type of the file. It may also contain
additional semantic information. There shall be exactly one space separating
&quot;<B><TT>#VRML</TT></B>&quot; from &quot;<B><TT>V2.0</TT></B>&quot;
and &quot;<B><TT>V2.0</TT></B>&quot; from &quot;&lt;<TT>encoding&nbsp;type</TT>&gt;&quot;.
Also, the &quot;&lt;<TT>encoding&nbsp;type</TT>&gt;&quot; shall be followed
by a linefeed (0x0a) or carriage-return (0x0d) character, or by one or more
space (0x20) or tab (0x09) characters followed by any other characters,
which are treated as a comment, and terminated by a linefeed or carriage-return
character.</P>

<P>The &lt;<TT>encoding type</TT>&gt; is either &quot;<B><TT>utf8</TT></B>&quot;
or any other authorized values defined in other parts of ISO/IEC 14772.
The identifier &quot;<B><TT><FONT FACE="Courier New">utf8</FONT></TT></B><FONT
 FACE="Courier New">&quot;</FONT> indicates a clear text encoding that allows
for international characters to be displayed in ISO/IEC 14772 using the
UTF-8 encoding defined in ISO/IEC 10646-1 (otherwise known as Unicode);
see <A HREF="references.html#[UTF8]">2.[UTF8]</A>. The usage of UTF-8 is
detailed in <A HREF="nodesRef.html#Text">6.47,&nbsp;Text</A>, node. The
header for a UTF-8 encoded VRML file is</P>

<PRE><B>#VRML V2.0 utf8 </B>[optional comment]<B> </B>&lt;line terminator&gt;</PRE>

<P>Any characters after the <TT>&lt;encoding type&gt;</TT> on the first
line may be ignored by a browser. The header line ends at the occurrence
of a <CODE>&lt;line terminator&gt;</CODE>. A <CODE>&lt;line terminator&gt;</CODE>
is a linefeed character (0x0a) or a carriage-return character (0x0d) .</P>

<H3><A NAME="4.2.3"></A>4.2.3 Scene graph</H3>

<P>The scene graph contains nodes which describe objects and their properties.
It contains hierarchically grouped geometry to provide an audio-visual representation
of objects, as well as nodes that participate in the event generation and
routing mechanism.</P>

<H3><A NAME="4.2.4"></A>4.2.4 Prototypes</H3>

<P>Prototypes allow the set of VRML node types to be extended by the user.
Prototype definitions can be included in the file in which they are used
or defined externally. Prototypes may be defined in terms of other VRML
nodes or may be defined using a browser-specific extension mechanism. While
ISO/IEC 14772 has a standard format for identifying such extensions, their
implementation is browser-dependent.</P>

<H3><A NAME="4.2.5"></A>4.2.5 Event routing</H3>

<P>Some VRML nodes generate events in response to environmental changes
or user interaction. Event routing gives authors a mechanism, separate from
the scene graph hierarchy, through which these events can be propagated
to effect changes in other nodes. Once generated, events are sent to their
routed destinations in time order and processed by the receiving node. This
processing can change the state of the node, generate additional events,
or change the structure of the scene graph.</P>

<P>Script nodes allow arbitrary, author-defined event processing. An event
received by a Script node causes the execution of a function within a script
which has the ability to send events through the normal event routing mechanism,
or bypass this mechanism and send events directly to any node to which the
Script node has a reference. Scripts can also dynamically add or delete
routes and thereby changing the event-routing topology.</P>

<P>The ideal event model processes all events instantaneously in the order
that they are generated. A timestamp serves two purposes. First, it is a
conceptual device used to describe the chronological flow of the event mechanism.
It ensures that deterministic results can be achieved by real-world implementations
that address processing delays and asynchronous interaction with external
devices. Second, timestamps are also made available to Script nodes to allow
events to be processed based on the order of user actions or the elapsed
time between events.</P>

<H3><A NAME="4.2.6"></A>4.2.6 Generating VRML files</H3>

<P>A <I>generator</I> is a human or computerized creator of VRML files.
It is the responsibility of the generator to ensure the correctness of the
VRML file and the availability of supporting assets (e.g.,&nbsp;images,
audio clips, other VRML files) referenced therein.</P>

<H3><A NAME="4.2.7"></A>4.2.7 Presentation and interaction</H3>

<P>The interpretation, execution, and presentation of VRML files will typically
be undertaken by a mechanism known as a browser, which displays the shapes
and sounds in the scene graph. This presentation is known as a <I>virtual
world</I> and is navigated in the browser by a human or mechanical entity,
known as a <I>user</I>. The world is displayed as if experienced from a
particular location; that position and orientation in the world is known
as the <I>viewer</I>. The browser provides navigation paradigms (such as
walking or flying) that enable the user to move the viewer through the virtual
world.</P>

<P>In addition to navigation, the browser provides a mechanism allowing
the user to interact with the world through sensor nodes in the scene graph
hierarchy. Sensors respond to user interaction with geometric objects in
the world, the movement of the user through the world, or the passage of
time.</P>

<P>The visual presentation of geometric objects in a VRML world follows
a conceptual model designed to resemble the physical characteristics of
light. The VRML lighting model describes how appearance properties and lights
in the world are combined to produce displayed colours (see <A HREF="#4.14">4.14,&nbsp;Lighting&nbsp;Model</A>,
for details).</P>

<P><A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A> illustrates a conceptual model of
a VRML browser. The browser is portrayed as a presentation application that
accepts user input in the forms of file selection (explicit and implicit)
and user interface gestures (e.g.,&nbsp;manipulation and navigation using
an input device). The three main components of the browser are: Parser,
Scene Graph, and Audio/Visual Presentation. The Parser component reads the
VRML file and creates the Scene Graph. The Scene Graph component consists
of the Transformation Hierarchy (the nodes) and the Route Graph. The Scene
Graph also includes the Execution Engine that processes events, reads and
edits the Route Graph, and makes changes to the Transform Hierarchy (nodes).
User input generally affects sensors and navigation, and thus is wired to
the Route Graph component (sensors) and the Audio/Visual Presentation component
(navigation). The Audio/Visual Presentation component performs the graphics
and audio rendering of the Transform Hierarchy that feeds back to the user.</P>

<H3><A NAME="4.2.8"></A>4.2.8 Profiles</H3>

<P>ISO/IEC 14772 supports the concept of profiles. A profile is a named
collection of functionality and requirements which shall be supported in
order for an implementation to conform to that profile. Only one profile
is defined in this part of ISO/IEC 14772. The functionality and minimum
support requirements described in ISO/IEC 14772-1 form the <I>Base</I> profile.
Additional profiles may be defined in other parts of ISO/IEC 14772. Such
profiles shall incorporate the entirety of the Base profile.</P>

<H3><A NAME="4.3.1"></A>4.3.1 Clear text (UTF-8) encoding</H3>

<P>This section describes the syntax of UTF-8-encoded, human-readable VRML
files. A more formal description of the syntax may be found in <A HREF=
"grammar.html">annex A, Grammar definition</A>. The semantics of VRML in
terms of the UTF-8 encoding are presented in this part of ISO/IEC 14772.
Other encodings may be defined in other parts of ISO/IEC 14772. Such encodings
shall describe how to map the UTF-8 descriptions to and from the corresponding
encoding elements.</P>

<P>For the UTF-8 encoding, the # character begins a comment. The first line
of the file, the header, also starts with a &quot;#&quot; character. Otherwise,
all characters following a &quot;#&quot;, until the next line terminator,
are ignored. The only exception is within double-quoted SFString and MFString
fields where the &quot;#&quot; character is defined to be part of the string.</P>

<P>Commas, spaces, tabs, linefeeds, and carriage-returns are separator characters
wherever they appear outside of string fields. Separator characters and
comments are collectively termed&nbsp;<I>whitespace</I>.</P>

<P>A VRML document server may strip comments and extra separators including
the comment portion of the header line from a VRML file before transmitting
it. <A HREF="nodesRef.html#WorldInfo">WorldInfo</A> nodes should be used
for persistent information such as copyrights or author information.</P>

<P>Field, event, PROTO, EXTERNPROTO, and node names shall not contain control
characters (0x0-0x1f, 0x7f), space (0x20), double or single quotes (0x22:&nbsp;&quot;,
0x27:&nbsp;'), sharp (0x23:&nbsp;#), comma (0x2c:&nbsp;,), period (0x2e:&nbsp;.),
brackets (0x5b, 0x5d: []), backslash (0x5c:&nbsp;\) or braces (0x7b,&nbsp;0x7d:&nbsp;{}).
Further, their first character shall not be a digit (0x30-0x39), plus (0x2b:&nbsp;+),
or minus (0x2d:&nbsp;-) character. Otherwise, names may contain any ISO
10646 character encoded using UTF-8. VRML is case-sensitive; &quot;Sphere&quot;
is different from &quot;sphere&quot; and &quot;BEGIN&quot; is different
from &quot;begin.&quot;</P>

<P>The following reserved keywords shall not be used for field, event, PROTO,
EXTERNPROTO, or node names:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>DEF
  <LI>EXTERNPROTO
  <LI>FALSE
  <LI>IS
  <LI>NULL

<H3><A NAME="4.3.2"></A>4.3.2 Statements</H3>

<P>After the required header, a VRML file may contain any combination of
the following:</P>

  <LI>Any number of ROUTE statements (see <A HREF="#4.10.2">4.10.2,&nbsp;Route&nbsp;semantics</A>).
</OL><!--/NOEDIT--></P>

<H3><A NAME="4.3.3"></A>4.3.3 Node statement syntax</H3>

<P>A node statement consists of an optional name for the node followed by
the node's type and then the body of the node. A node is given a name using
the keyword DEF followed by the name of the node. The node's body is enclosed
in matching braces (&quot;<B><TT>{</TT>&nbsp;<TT>}</TT></B>&quot;). Whitespace
shall separate the DEF, name of the node, and node type, but is not required
before or after the curly braces that enclose the node's body. See <A HREF=
"grammar.html#Nodes">A.3, Nodes</A>, for details on node grammar rules.</P>

<PRE>
    [<B>DEF</B> &lt;name&gt;] &lt;nodeType&gt; <B>{ </B>&lt;body&gt; <B>}</B></PRE>

<P>A node's body consists of any number of field statements, IS statements,
ROUTE statements, PROTO statements or EXTERNPROTO statements, in any order.</P>

<P>See <A HREF="#4.6.2">4.6.2,&nbsp;DEF/USE</A>,&nbsp;sematnics for more
details on node naming. See <A HREF="#4.3.4">4.3.4,&nbsp;Field&nbsp;statement&nbsp;syntax</A>,

for a description of node statement semantics.</P>

<H3><A NAME="4.3.4"></A>4.3.4 Field statement syntax</H3>

<P>A field statement consists of the name of the field followed by the field's
value(s). The following illustrates the syntax for a single-valued field:</P>

<H3><A NAME="4.4.1"></A>4.4.1 Root nodes</H3>

<P>A VRML file contains zero or more root nodes. The root nodes for a VRML
file are those nodes defined by the node statements or USE statements that
are not contained in other node or PROTO statements. Root nodes shall be
children nodes (see <A HREF="#4.6.5">4.6.5,&nbsp;Grouping&nbsp;and&nbsp;children&nbsp;nodes</A>).</P>

<H3><A NAME="4.4.2"></A>4.4.2 Scene graph hierarchy</H3>

<P>A VRML file contains a directed acyclic graph. Node statements can contain
SFNode or MFNode field statements that, in turn, contain node (or USE) statements.
This hierarchy of nodes is called the <I>scene graph</I>. Each arc in the
graph from A to B means that node A has an SFNode or MFNode field whose
value directly contains node B. See <A HREF="bibliography.html#[FOLE]">E.[FOLE]</A>
for details on hierarchical scene graphs.</P>

<H3><A NAME="4.4.3"></A>4.4.3 Descendant and ancestor nodes</H3>

<P>The <I>descendants</I> of a node are all of the nodes in its SFNode or
MFNode fields, as well as all of those nodes' descendants. The <I>ancestors</I>
of a node are all of the nodes that have the node as a descendant.</P>

<H3><A NAME="4.4.4"></A>4.4.4 Transformation hierarchy</H3>

<P>The transformation hierarchy includes all of the root nodes and root
node descendants that are considered to have one or more particular locations
in the virtual world. VRML includes the notion of <I>local coordinate systems</I>,
defined in terms of transformations from ancestor coordinate systems (using
Transform or Billboard nodes). The coordinate system in which the root nodes
are displayed is called the <I>world coordinate system</I>.</P>

<P>A VRML browser's task is to present a VRML file to the user; it does
this by presenting the transformation hierarchy to the user. The transformation
hierarchy describes the directly perceptible parts of the virtual world.</P>

<P>The following node types are in the scene graph but not affected by the
transformation hierarchy: ColorInterpolator, CoordinateInterpolator, NavigationInfo,
NormalInterpolator, OrientationInterpolator, PositionInterpolator, Script,
ScalarInterpolator, TimeSensor, and WorldInfo. Of these, only Script nodes
may have descendants. A descendant of a Script node is not part of the transformation
hierarchy unless it is also the descendant of another node that is part
of the transformation hierarchy or is a root node.</P>

<P>Nodes that are descendants of LOD or Switch nodes are affected by the
transformation hierarchy, even if the settings of a Switch node's <I>whichChoice</I>
field or the position of the viewer with respect to a LOD node makes them
imperceptible.</P>

<P>The transformation hierarchy shall be a directed acyclic graph; results
are undefined if a node in the transformation hierarchy is its own ancestor.</P>

<H3><A NAME="4.4.5"></A>4.4.5 Standard units and coordinate system</H3>

<P>ISO/IEC 14772 defines the unit of measure of the world coordinate system

specifies a file located on a particular server and accessed through a specified
protocol (e.g.,&nbsp;http). In ISO/IEC 14772, the upper-case term URL&nbsp;refers
to a Uniform Resource Locator, while the italicized lower-case version <I>url</I>
refers to a field which may contain URLs or in-line encoded data.</P>

<P>All <I>url </I>fields are of type MFString. The strings in these fields
indicate multiple locations to search for data in decreasing order of preference.
If the browser cannot locate or interpret the data specified by the first
location, it shall try the second and subsequent locations in order until
a URL containing interpretable data is encountered. If no interpretable
URL's are located, the node type defines the resultant default behaviour.
The <I>url</I> field entries are delimited by double quotation marks &quot;&nbsp;&quot;.
Due to <A HREF="#4.5.4">4.5.4,&nbsp;Scripting&nbsp;language&nbsp;protocols</A>,

defined in the corresponding annex of ISO/IEC 14772 for any scripting language
which is supported. The following example illustrates the use of mixing
custom protocols and standard protocols in a single <I>url</I> field (order

<H4><A NAME="4.6.3.4"></A>4.6.3.4 Shape hint fields</H4>

<P>The Extrusion and IndexedFaceSet nodes each have three SFBool fields
that provide hints about the geometry. These hints specify the vertex ordering,
if the shape is solid, and if the shape contains convex faces. These fields
are <I>ccw</I>, <I>solid</I>, and <I>convex</I>, respectively. The ElevationGrid
node has the <I>ccw</I> and <I>solid</I> fields.</P>

<P>The <I>ccw</I> field defines the ordering of the vertex coordinates of
the geometry with respect to user-given or automatically generated normal
vectors used in the lighting model equations. If <I>ccw</I> is TRUE, the
normals shall follow the right hand rule; the orientation of each normal
with respect to the vertices (taken in order) shall be such that the vertices
appear to be oriented in a counterclockwise order when the vertices are
viewed (in the local coordinate system of the Shape) from the opposite direction
as the normal. If <I>ccw</I> is FALSE, the normals shall be oriented in
the opposite direction. If normals are not generated but are supplied using
a Normal node, and the orientation of the normals does not match the setting
of the <I>ccw</I> field, results are undefined.</P>

<P>The <I>solid</I> field determines whether one or both sides of each polygon
shall be displayed. If <I>solid</I> is FALSE, each polygon shall be visible
regardless of the viewing direction (i.e.,&nbsp;no backface culling shall
be done, and two-sided lighting shall be performed to illuminate both sides
of lit surfaces). If <I>solid</I> is TRUE, the visibility of each polygon
shall be determined as follows: Let <B><I>V</I></B> be the position of the
viewer in the local coordinate system of the geometry. Let <B><I>N</I></B>
be the geometric normal vector of the polygon, and let <B><I>P</I></B> be
any point (besides the local origin) in the plane defined by the polygon's
vertices. Then if (<B><I>V</I></B> dot <B><I>N</I></B>) - (<B><I>N</I></B>
dot <B><I>P</I></B>) is greater than zero, the polygon shall be visible;
if it is less than or equal to zero, the polygon shall be invisible (backface
culled).</P>

<P>The <I>convex</I> field indicates whether all polygons in the shape are
convex (TRUE). A polygon is convex if it is planar, does not intersect itself,
and all of the interior angles at its vertices are less than 180 degrees.
Non-planar and self-intersecting polygons may produce undefined results
even if the <I>convex</I> field is FALSE.</P>

<H4><A NAME="4.6.3.5"></A>4.6.3.5 Crease angle field</H4>

<P>The <I>creaseAngle</I> field, used by the ElevationGrid, Extrusion, and
IndexedFaceSet nodes, affects how default normals are generated. If the
angle between the geometric normals of two adjacent faces is less than the
crease angle, normals shall be calculated so that the faces are smooth-shaded
across the edge; otherwise, normals shall be calculated so that a lighting
discontinuity across the edge is produced. For example, a crease angle of
0.5 radians means that an edge between two adjacent polygonal faces will
be smooth shaded if the geometric normals of the two faces form an angle
that is less than 0.5 radians. Otherwise, the faces will appear faceted.
Crease angles shall be greater than or equal to 0.0.</P>

<H3><A NAME="4.6.4"></A>4.6.4 Bounding boxes</H3>

<P>Several of the nodes include a bounding box specification comprised of
two fields, <I>bboxSize </I>and <I>bboxCenter</I>. A bounding box is a rectangular
parallelepiped of dimension <I>bboxSize </I>centred on the location <I>bboxCenter
</I>in the local coordinate system. This is typically used by grouping nodes
to provide a hint to the browser on the group's approximate size for culling
optimizations. The default size for bounding boxes (-1,&nbsp;-1,&nbsp;-1)
indicates that the user did not specify the bounding box and the effect
shall be as if the bounding box were infinitely large. A <I>bboxSize</I>
value of (0,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;0) is valid and represents a point in space (i.e.,&nbsp;an<I>
</I>infinitely small box). Specified <I>bboxSize</I> field values shall
be &gt;= 0.0 or equal to (-1,&nbsp;-1,&nbsp;-1). The <I>bboxCenter</I> fields
specify a position offset from the local coordinate system.</P>

<P>The <I>bboxCenter</I> and <I>bboxSize</I> fields may be used to specify
a maximum possible bounding box for the objects inside a grouping node (e.g.,&nbsp;Transform).
These are used as hints to optimize certain operations such as determining
whether or not the group needs to be drawn. The bounding box shall be large
enough at all times to enclose the union of the group's children's bounding
boxes; it shall not include any transformations performed by the group itself
(i.e., the bounding box is defined in the local coordinate system of the
children). Results are undefined if the specified bounding box is smaller
than the true bounding box of the group.</P>

<H3><A NAME="4.6.5"></A>4.6.5 Grouping and children nodes</H3>

<P>Grouping nodes have a field that contains a list of children nodes. Each
grouping node defines a coordinate space for its children. This coordinate
space is relative to the coordinate space of the node of which the group
node is a child. Such a node is called a <I>parent</I> node. This means
that transformations accumulate down the scene graph hierarchy.</P>

<H3><A NAME="4.6.6"></A>4.6.6 Light sources</H3>

<P>Shape nodes are illuminated by the sum of all of the lights in the world
that affect them. This includes the contribution of both the direct and
ambient illumination from light sources. Ambient illumination results from
the scattering and reflection of light originally emitted directly by light
sources. The amount of ambient light is associated with the individual lights
in the scene. This is a gross approximation to how ambient reflection actually
occurs in nature.</P>

<P>The following node types are light source nodes:</P>

<UL>
  <LI><A HREF="nodesRef.html#DirectionalLight">DirectionalLight</A>
  <LI><A HREF="nodesRef.html#PointLight">PointLight</A>
  <LI><A HREF="nodesRef.html#SpotLight">SpotLight</A>
</UL>

<P>All light source nodes contain an <I>intensity</I>, a <I>color</I>, and
an <I>ambientIntensity</I> field. The <I>intensity</I> field specifies the
brightness of the direct emission from the light, and the <I>ambientIntensity</I>
specifies the intensity of the ambient emission from the light. Light intensity
may range from 0.0 (no light emission) to 1.0 (full intensity). The <I>color
</I>field specifies the spectral colour properties of both the direct and
ambient light emission as an RGB value.</P>

<P>PointLight and SpotLight illuminate all objects in the world that fall
within their volume of lighting influence regardless of location within
the transformation hierarchy. PointLight defines this volume of influence
as a sphere centred at the light (defined by a radius). SpotLight defines
the volume of influence as a solid angle defined by a radius and a cutoff
angle. DirectionalLight nodes illuminate only the objects descended from
the light's parent grouping node, including any descendent children of the
parent grouping nodes.</P>

<P>Sensors are children nodes in the hierarchy and therefore may be parented
by grouping nodes as described in <A HREF="#4.6.5">4.6.5,&nbsp;Grouping&nbsp;and&nbsp;children
nodes</A>.</P>

<P>Each type of sensor defines when an event is generated. The state of
the scene graph after several sensors have generated events shall be as
if each event is processed separately, in order. If sensors generate events
at the same time, the state of the scene graph will be undefined if the
results depend on the ordering of the events.</P>

<P>It is possible to create dependencies between various types of sensors.
For example, a TouchSensor may result in a change to a VisibilitySensor
node's transformation, which in turn may cause the VisibilitySensor node's
visibility status to change.</P>

<P>The following two sections classify sensors into two categories: <I>environmental
sensors</I> and <I>pointing-device sensors</I>.</P>

<H4><A NAME="4.6.7.2"></A>4.6.7.2 Environmental sensors</H4>

<P>The following node types are environmental sensors:</P>

<UL>
  <LI><A HREF="nodesRef.html#Collision">Collision</A>
  <LI><A HREF="nodesRef.html#ProximitySensor">ProximitySensor</A>
  <LI><A HREF="nodesRef.html#TimeSensor">TimeSensor</A>
  <LI><A HREF="nodesRef.html#VisibilitySensor">VisibilitySensor</A>
</UL>

<P>The <A HREF="nodesRef.html#ProximitySensor">ProximitySensor</A> detects
when the user navigates into a specified region in the world. The ProximitySensor
itself is not visible. The <A HREF="nodesRef.html#TimeSensor">TimeSensor</A>
is a clock that has no geometry or location associated with it; it is used
to start and stop time-based nodes such as interpolators. The <A HREF="nodesRef.html#VisibilitySensor">VisibilitySensor</A>
detects when a specific part of the world becomes visible to the user. The
<A HREF="nodesRef.html#Collision">Collision</A> grouping node detects when
the user collides with objects in the virtual world. Proximity, time, collision,
and visibility sensors are each processed independently of whether others
exist or overlap.</P>

<P>When environmental sensors are inserted into the transformation hierarchy
and before the presentation is updated (i.e.,&nbsp;read from file or created
by a script), they shall generate events indicating any conditions which
the sensor is intended to detect (see <A HREF="#4.10.3">4.10.3,&nbsp;Execution&nbsp;model</A>).
The conditions for individual sensor types to generate these initial events
are defined in the individual node specifications in <A HREF="nodesRef.html">6,
Node reference</A>.</P>

<H4><A NAME="4.6.7.3"></A>4.6.7.3 Pointing-device sensors</H4>

<P>Pointing-device sensors detect user pointing events such as the user
clicking on a piece of geometry (i.e.,&nbsp;TouchSensor). The following
node types are pointing-device sensors:</P>

<UL>
  <LI><A HREF="nodesRef.html#Anchor">Anchor</A>
  <LI><A HREF="nodesRef.html#CylinderSensor">CylinderSensor</A>
  <LI><A HREF="nodesRef.html#PlaneSensor">PlaneSensor</A>
  <LI><A HREF="nodesRef.html#SphereSensor">SphereSensor</A>
  <LI><A HREF="nodesRef.html#TouchSensor">TouchSensor</A>
</UL>

<P>A pointing-device sensor is activated when the user locates the pointing
device over geometry that is influenced by that specific pointing-device
sensor. Pointing-device sensors have influence over all geometry that is
descended from the sensor's parent groups. In the case of the Anchor node,
the Anchor node itself is considered to be the parent group. Typically,
the pointing-device sensor is a sibling to the geometry that it influences.
In other cases, the sensor is a sibling to groups which contain geometry
(i.e.,&nbsp;are influenced by the pointing-device sensor).</P>

<P>The appearance properties of the geometry do not affect activation of
the sensor. In particular, transparent materials or textures shall be treated
as opaque with respect to activation of pointing-device sensors.</P>

<P>For a given user activation, the lowest enabled pointing-device sensor
in the hierarchy is activated. All other pointing-device sensors above the
lowest enabled pointing-device sensor are ignored. The hierarchy is defined
by the geometry node over which the pointing-device sensor is located and
the entire hierarchy upward. If there are multiple pointing-device sensors
tied for lowest, each of these is activated simultaneously and independently,
possibly resulting in multiple sensors activating and generating output
simultaneously. This feature allows combinations of pointing-device sensors
(e.g.,&nbsp;TouchSensor and PlaneSensor). If a pointing-device sensor appears
in the transformation hierarchy multiple times (DEF/USE), it shall be tested
for activation in all of the coordinate systems in which it appears.</P>

<P>If a pointing-device sensor is not enabled when the pointing-device button
is activated, it will not generate events related to the pointing device
until after the pointing device is deactivated and the sensor is enabled
(i.e.,&nbsp;enabling a sensor in the middle of dragging does not result
in the sensor activating immediately).</P>

<P>The <A HREF="nodesRef.html#Anchor">Anchor</A> node is considered to be
a pointing-device sensor when trying to determine which sensor (or Anchor
node) to activate. For example, a click on <I>Shape3</I> is handled by <I>SensorD</I>,
a click on <I>Shape2</I> is handled by <I>SensorC</I> and the <I>AnchorA</I>,
and a click on <I>Shape1</I> is handled by <I>SensorA</I> and <I>SensorB</I>:</P>

<H4><A NAME="4.6.7.4"></A>4.6.7.4 Drag sensors</H4>

<P><I>Drag sensors</I> are a subset of pointing-device sensors. There are
three types of drag sensors: <A HREF="nodesRef.html#CylinderSensor">CylinderSensor</A>,
<A HREF="nodesRef.html#PlaneSensor">PlaneSensor</A>, and <A HREF="nodesRef.html#SphereSensor">SphereSensor</A>.
Drag sensors have two eventOuts in common, <I>trackPoint_changed</I> and
<I>&lt;value&gt;_changed</I>. These eventOuts send events for each movement
of the activated pointing device according to their &quot;virtual geometry&quot;
(e.g., cylinder for CylinderSensor). The <I>trackPoint_changed</I> eventOut
sends the intersection point of the <I>bearing</I> with the drag sensor's
virtual geometry. The <I>&lt;value&gt;_changed</I> eventOut sends the sum
of the relative change since activation plus the sensor's <I>offset</I>
field. The type and name of <I>&lt;value&gt;_changed</I> depends on the
drag sensor type: <I>rotation_changed</I> for CylinderSensor, <I>translation_changed</I>
for PlaneSensor, and <I>rotation_changed</I> for SphereSensor.</P>

<P>To simplify the application of these sensors, each node has an <I>offset</I>
and an <I>autoOffset</I> exposed field. When the sensor generates events
as a response to the activated pointing device motion, <I>&lt;value&gt;_changed</I>
sends the sum of the relative change since the initial activation plus the
<I>offset</I> field value. If <I>autoOffset</I> is TRUE when the pointing-device
is deactivated, the <I>offset</I> field is set to the sensor's last <I>&lt;value&gt;_changed</I>
value and <I>offset</I> sends an <I>offset_changed</I> eventOut. This enables
subsequent grabbing operations to accumulate the changes. If <I>autoOffset</I>
is FALSE, the sensor does not set the <I>offset</I> field value at deactivation
(or any other time).</P>

<H4><A NAME="4.6.7.5"></A>4.6.7.5 Activating and manipulating sensors</H4>

<P>The pointing device controls a pointer in the virtual world. While activated
by the pointing device, a sensor will generate events as the pointer moves.
Typically the pointing device may be categorized as either 2D (e.g., conventional
mouse) or 3D (e.g., wand). It is suggested that the pointer controlled by
a 2D device is mapped onto a plane a fixed distance from the viewer and
perpendicular to the line of sight. The mapping of a 3D device may describe
a 1:1 relationship between movement of the pointing device and movement
of the pointer.</P>

<P>The position of the pointer defines a bearing which is used to determine
which geometry is being indicated. When implementing a 2D pointing device
it is suggested that the bearing is defined by the vector from the viewer
position through the location of the pointer. When implementing a 3D pointing
device it is suggested that the bearing is defined by extending a vector
from the current position of the pointer in the direction indicated by the
pointer.</P>

<P>In all cases the pointer is considered to be indicating a specific geometry
when that geometry is intersected by the bearing. If the bearing intersects
multiple sensors' geometries, only the sensor nearest to the pointer will
be eligible for activation.</P>

<H3><A NAME="4.6.8"></A>4.6.8 Interpolator nodes</H3>

<P>Interpolator nodes are designed for linear keyframed animation. An interpolator
node defines a piecewise-linear function, <I>f(t)</I>, on the interval (<I>-infinity,
+infinity).</I> The piecewise-linear function is defined by <I>n</I> values
of <I>t</I>, called <I>key</I>, and the <I>n</I> corresponding values of
<I>f(t)</I>, called <I>keyValue</I>. The keys shall be monotonically non-decreasing,
otherwise the results are undefined. The keys are not restricted to any
interval.</P>

<P>An interpolator node evaluates <I>f(t)</I> given any value of <I>t</I>
(via the <I>set_fraction</I><TT> </TT>eventIn) as follows: Let the <I>n</I>

    eventOut     [S|M]F&lt;type&gt; value_changed</PRE>

<P>The type of the<I> keyValue </I>field is dependent on the type of the
interpolator (e.g.,&nbsp;the ColorInterpolator's <I>keyValue</I> field is
of type MFColor).</P>

<P>The <I>set_fraction</I> eventIn receives an SFFloat event and causes
the interpolator function to evaluate, resulting in a <I>value_changed</I>
eventOut with the same timestamp as the <I>set_fraction</I> event.</P>

<P>ColorInterpolator, OrientationInterpolator, PositionInterpolator, and
ScalarInterpolator output a single-value field to <I>value_changed</I>.
Each value in the <I>keyValue</I> field corresponds in order to the parameter
value in the <I>key</I> field. Results are undefined if the number of values
in the <I>key</I> field of an interpolator is not the same as the number
of values in the <I>keyValue</I> field.</P>

<P>CoordinateInterpolator and NormalInterpolator send multiple-value results
to <I>value_changed</I>. In this case, the <I>keyValue</I> field is an <I>n&nbsp;</I>x&nbsp;<I>m</I>
array of values, where <I>n</I> is the number of values in the key field
and <I>m</I> is the number of values at each keyframe. Each <I>m</I> values
in the <I>keyValue</I> field correspond, in order, to a parameter value
in the <I>key</I> field. Each <I>value_changed</I> event shall contain <I>m</I>
interpolated values. Results are undefined if the number of values in the
<I>keyValue</I> field divided by the number of values in the <I>key</I>
field is not a positive integer.</P>

<P>If an interpolator node's <I>value</I> eventOut is read before it receives
any inputs, <I>keyValue</I>[0] is returned if <I>keyValue</I> is not empty.
If <I>keyValue</I> is empty (i.e.,&nbsp;[&nbsp;]), the initial value for
the eventOut type is returned (e.g.,&nbsp;(0,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;0) for SFVec3f);
see <A HREF="fieldsRef.html">5, Field and event&nbsp;reference</A>, for
initial event values.</P>

<P>The location of an interpolator node in the transformation hierarchy
has no effect on its operation. For example, if a parent of an interpolator
node is a Switch node with <I>whichChoice</I> set to -1 (i.e.,&nbsp;ignore
its children), the interpolator continues to operate as specified (receives
and sends events).</P>

<H3><A NAME="4.6.9"></A>4.6.9 Time-dependent nodes</H3>

<P><A HREF="nodesRef.html#AudioClip">AudioClip</A>, <A HREF="nodesRef.html#MovieTexture">MovieTexture</A>,
and <A HREF="nodesRef.html#TimeSensor">TimeSensor</A> are <I>time-dependent</I>
nodes that activate and deactivate themselves at specified times. Each of
these nodes contains the exposedFields: <I>startTime</I>, <I>stopTime</I>,
and <I>loop, </I>and the eventOut: <I>isActive</I>. The values of the exposedFields
are used to determine when the node becomes active or inactive Also, under
certain conditions, these nodes ignore events to some of their exposedFields.
A node ignores an eventIn by not accepting the new value and not generating
an eventOut<I>_changed</I> event. In this subclause, an abstract time-dependent
node can be any one of AudioClip, MovieTexture, or TimeSensor.</P>

<P>Time-dependent nodes can execute for 0 or more cycles. A cycle is defined
by field data within the node. If, at the end of a cycle, the value of <I>loop</I>
is FALSE, execution is terminated (see below for events at termination).
Conversely, if <I>loop</I> is TRUE at the end of a cycle, a time-dependent
node continues execution into the next cycle. A time-dependent node with
<I>loop</I> TRUE at the end of every cycle continues cycling forever if
<I>startTime&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;stopTime</I>, or until <I>stopTime </I>if<I>
&nbsp;startTime &lt; stopTime</I>.</P>

<P>A time-dependent node generates an <I>isActive</I> TRUE event when it
becomes active and generates an <I>isActive</I> FALSE event when it becomes
inactive. These are the only times at which an <I>isActive</I> event is
generated. In particular, <I>isActive </I>events are not sent at each tick
of a simulation.</P>

<P>A time-dependent node is inactive until its <I>startTime</I> is reached.
When time <I>now</I> becomes greater than or equal to <I>startTime, </I>an
<I>isActive</I> TRUE event is generated and the time-dependent node becomes
active (<I>now</I> refers to the time at which the browser is simulating
and displaying the virtual world). When a time-dependent node is read from
a VRML file and the ROUTEs specified within the VRML file have been established,
the node should determine if it is active and, if so, generate an <I>isActive</I>
TRUE event and begin generating any other necessary events. However, if
a node would have become inactive at any time before the reading of the
VRML file, no events are generated upon the completion of the read.</P>

<P>An active time-dependent node will become inactive when <I>stopTime</I>
is reached if <I>stopTime&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;startTime.</I> The value of<I>
stopTime </I>is ignored if<I> stopTime&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;startTime</I>. Also,
an active time-dependent node will become inactive at the end of the current
cycle if <I>loop</I> is FALSE. If an active time-dependent node receives
a <I>set_loop</I> FALSE event, execution continues until the end of the
current cycle or until <I>stopTime</I> (if <I>stopTime&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;startTime</I>),
whichever occurs first. The termination at the end of cycle can be overridden
by a subsequent <I>set_loop </I>TRUE event.</P>

<P>Any <I>set_startTime</I> events to an active time-dependent node are
ignored. Any <I>set_stopTime</I> event where <I>stopTime</I> &lt;= <I>startTime</I>
sent to an active time-dependent node is also ignored. A <I>set_stopTime</I>
event where <I>startTime&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;stopTime&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;now</I>
sent to an active time-dependent node results in events being generated
as if <I>stopTime</I> has just been reached. That is, final events, including
an <I>isActive </I>FALSE, are generated and the node becomes inactive. The
<I>stopTime_changed</I> event will have the <I>set_stopTime</I> value. Other
final events are node-dependent (c.f.,&nbsp;TimeSensor).</P>

<P>A time-dependent node may be restarted while it is active by sending
a <I>set_stopTime</I> event equal to the current time (which will cause
the node to become inactive) and a <I>set_startTime</I> event, setting it
to the current time or any time in the future. These events will have the
same time stamp and should be processed as <I>set_stopTime, </I>then<I>
set_startTime </I>to produce the correct behaviour.</P>

<P>The default values for each of the time-dependent nodes are specified
such that any node with default values is already inactive (and, therefore,
will generate no events upon loading). A time-dependent node can be defined
such that it will be active upon reading by specifying <I>loop</I> TRUE.
This use of a non-terminating time-dependent node should be used with caution
since it incurs continuous overhead on the simulation.</P>

<P><A HREF="#Figure4.2">Figure 4.2</A> illustrates the behavior of several
common cases of time-dependent nodes. In each case, the initial conditions
of <I>startTime</I>, <I>stopTime</I>, <I>loop</I>, and the time-dependent
node's cycle interval are labelled, the red region denotes the time period
during which the time-dependent node is active, the arrows represent eventIns
received by and eventOuts sent by the time-dependent node, and the horizontal

<P>The PROTO statement defines a new node type in terms of already defined
(built-in or prototyped) node types. Once defined, prototyped node types
may be instantiated in the scene graph exactly like the built-in node types.</P>

<P>Node type names shall be unique in each VRML file. The results are undefined
if a prototype is given the same name as a built-in node type or a previously
defined prototype in the same scope.</P>

<H3><A NAME="4.8.2"></A>4.8.2 PROTO interface declaration semantics</H3>

<P>The prototype interface defines the fields, eventIns, and eventOuts for
the new node type. The interface declaration includes the types and names
for the eventIns and eventOuts of the prototype, as well as the types, names,
and default values for the prototype's fields.</P>

<P>The interface declaration may contain exposedField declarations, which
are a convenient way of defining a field, eventIn, and eventOut at the same
time. If an exposedField named <I>zzz</I> is declared, it is equivalent
to declaring a field named <I>zzz</I>, an eventIn named <I>set_zzz</I>,
and an eventOut named <I>zzz_changed</I>.</P>

<P>Each prototype instance can be considered to be a complete copy of the
prototype, with its own fields, events, and copy of the prototype definition.
A prototyped node type is instantiated using standard node syntax. For example,
the following prototype (which has an empty interface declaration):</P>

<PRE>
<B>    PROTO Cube [ ] { Box { } }</B></PRE>

<P>may be instantiated as follows:</P>

<PRE>
<B>    Shape { geometry Cube { } }</B></PRE>

<P>It is recommended that user-defined field or event names defined in PROTO
interface declarations statements follow the naming conventions described
in <A HREF="#4.7">4.7,&nbsp;Field,&nbsp;eventIn,&nbsp;and&nbsp;eventOut&nbsp;semantics</A>.</P>

<P>If an eventOut in the prototype declaration is associated with an exposedField
in the prototype definition, the initial value of the eventOut shall be
the initial value of the exposedField. If the eventOut is associated with
multiple exposedFields, the results are undefined.</P>

<H3><A NAME="4.8.3"></A>4.8.3 PROTO definition semantics</H3>

<P>A prototype definition consists of one or more nodes, nested PROTO statements,
and ROUTE statements. The first node type determines how instantiations
of the prototype can be used in a VRML file. An instantiation is created
by filling in the parameters of the prototype declaration and inserting
copies of the first node (and its scene graph) wherever the prototype instantiation
occurs. For example, if the first node in the prototype definition is a
Material node, instantiations of the prototype can be used wherever a Material
node can be used. Any other nodes and accompanying scene graphs are not
part of the transformation hierarchy, but may be referenced by ROUTE statements
or Script nodes in the prototype definition.</P>

<P>Nodes in the prototype definition may have their fields, eventIns, or
eventOuts associated with the fields, eventIns, and eventOuts of the prototype
interface declaration. This is accomplished using IS statements in the body
of the node. When prototype instances are read from a VRML file, field values
for the fields of the prototype interface may be given. If given, the field
values are used for all nodes in the prototype definition that have IS statements
for those fields. Similarly, when a prototype instance is sent an event,
the event is delivered to all nodes that have IS statements for that event.
When a node in a prototype instance generates an event that has an IS statement,
the event is sent to any eventIns connected (via ROUTE) to the prototype
instance's eventOut.</P>

<P>IS statements may appear inside the prototype definition wherever fields
may appear. IS statements shall refer to fields or events defined in the

<P>The EXTERNPROTO statement defines a new node type. It is equivalent to
the PROTO statement, with two exceptions. First, the implementation of the
node type is stored externally, either in a VRML file containing an appropriate
PROTO statement or using some other implementation-dependent mechanism.
Second, default values for fields are not given since the implementation
will define appropriate defaults.</P>

<H3><A NAME="4.9.2"></A>4.9.2 EXTERNPROTO interface semantics</H3>

<P>The semantics of the EXTERNPROTO are exactly the same as for a PROTO
statement, except that default field and exposedField values are not specified
locally. In addition, events sent to an instance of an externally prototyped
node may be ignored until the implementation of the node is found.</P>

<P>Until the definition has been loaded, the browser shall determine the
initial value of exposedFields using the following rules (in order of precedence):</P>

<P><!--NOEDIT--><OL START="1" TYPE="a">
  <LI>the user-defined value in the instantiation (if one is specified);
  <LI>the default value for that field type.
</OL><!--/NOEDIT--></P>

<P>For eventOuts, the initial value on startup will be the default value
for that field type. During the loading of an EXTERNPROTO, if an initial
value of an eventOut is found, that value is applied to the eventOut and
no event is generated.</P>

<P>The names and types of the fields, exposedFields, eventIns, and eventOuts
of the interface declaration shall be a subset of those defined in the implementation.
Declaring a field or event with a non-matching name is an error, as is declaring
a field or event with a matching name but a different type.</P>

<P>It is recommended that user-defined field or event names defined in EXTERNPROTO
interface statements follow the naming conventions described in <A HREF=
"#4.7">4.7,&nbsp;Field,&nbsp;eventIn,&nbsp;and&nbsp;eventOut&nbsp;semantics</A>.</P>

<H3><A NAME="4.9.3"></A>4.9.3 EXTERNPROTO URL semantics</H3>

<P>The string or strings specified after the interface declaration give
the location of the prototype's implementation. If multiple strings are
specified, the browser searches in the order of preference (see <A HREF=
"#4.5.2">4.5.2, URLs</A>).</P>

<P>If a URL in an EXTERNPROTO statement refers to a VRML file, the first
PROTO statement found in the VRML file (excluding EXTERNPROTOs) is used
to define the external prototype's definition. The name of that prototype
does not need to match the name given in the EXTERNPROTO statement. Results
are undefined if a URL in an EXTERNPROTO statement refers to a non-VRML
file</P>

<P>To enable the creation of libraries of reusable PROTO definitions, browsers
shall recognize EXTERNPROTO URLs that end with &quot;<B>#</B><I>name</I>&quot;
to mean the PROTO statement for &quot;name&quot; in the given VRML file.
For example, a library of standard materials might be stored in a VRML file
called &quot;materials.wrl&quot; that looks like:</P>

<H3><A NAME="4.10.1"></A>4.10.1 Introduction</H3>

<P>Most node types have at least one eventIn definition and thus can receive
<I>events.</I> Incoming events are data messages sent by other nodes to
change some state within the receiving node. Some nodes also have eventOut
definitions. These are used to send data messages to destination nodes that
some state has changed within the source node.</P>

<P>If an eventOut is read before it has sent any events, the <I>initial</I>
<I>value</I> as specified in <A HREF="fieldsRef.html">5,&nbsp;Field&nbsp;and&nbsp;event&nbsp;reference</A>,
for each field/event type is returned.</P>

<H3><A NAME="4.10.2"></A>4.10.2 Route semantics</H3>

<P>The connection between the node generating the event and the node receiving
the event is called a <I>route</I>. Routes are not nodes. The ROUTE statement
is a construct for establishing event paths between nodes. ROUTE statements
may either appear at the top level of a VRML file, in a prototype definition,
or inside a node wherever fields may appear. Nodes referenced in a ROUTE&nbsp;statement
shall be defined before the ROUTE&nbsp;statement.</P>

<P>The types of the eventIn and the eventOut shall match exactly. For example,
it is illegal to route from an SFFloat to an SFInt32 or from an SFFloat
to an MFFloat.</P>

<P>Routes may be established only from eventOuts to eventIns. For convenience,
when routing to or from an eventIn or eventOut (or the eventIn or eventOut
part of an exposedField), the <I>set_</I> or <I>_changed</I> part of the
event's name is optional. If the browser is trying to establish a ROUTE
to an eventIn named <I>zzz</I> and an eventIn of that name is not found,
the browser shall then try to establish the ROUTE to the eventIn named <I>set_zzz</I>.
Similarly, if establishing a ROUTE from an eventOut named <I>zzz</I> and
an eventOut of that name is not found, the browser shall try to establish
the ROUTE from <I>zzz_changed</I>.</P>

<P>Redundant routing is ignored. If a VRML file repeats a routing path,
the second and subsequent identical routes are ignored. This also applies
for routes created dynamically via a scripting language supported by the
browser.</P>

<H3><A NAME="4.10.3"></A>4.10.3 Execution model</H3>

<P>Once a sensor or Script has generated an <I>initial event</I>, the event
is propagated from the eventOut producing the event along any ROUTEs to
other nodes. These other nodes may respond by generating additional events,
continuing until all routes have been honoured. This process is called an
<I>event cascade</I>. All events generated during a given event cascade
are assigned the same timestamp as the initial event, since all are considered
to happen instantaneously.</P>

<P>Some sensors generate multiple events simultaneously. Similarly, it is
possible that asynchronously generated events could arrive at the identical
time as one or more sensor generated event. In these cases, all events generated
are part of the same initial event cascade and each event has the same timestamp.</P>

<P>After all events of the initial event cascade are honored, post-event
processing performs actions stimulated by the event cascade. The entire
sequence of events occuring in a single timestamp are:</P>

However, executing the <I>eventsProcessed</I> method for <B>Script 3</B>

<P>The browser controls the passage of time in a world by causing TimeSensors
to generate events as time passes. Specialized browsers or authoring applications
may cause time to pass more quickly or slowly than in the real world, but
typically the times generated by TimeSensors will approximate &quot;real&quot;
time. A world's creator should make no assumptions about how often a TimeSensor
will generate events but can safely assume that each time event generated
will have a timestamp greater than any previous time event.</P>

<H3><A NAME="4.11.2"></A>4.11.2 Time origin</H3>

<P>Time (0.0) is equivalent to 00:00:00 GMT January 1, 1970. Absolute times

numbers representing seconds. Negative absolute times are interpreted as

<H3><A NAME="4.11.3"></A>4.11.3 Discrete and continuous changes</H3>

<P>ISO/IEC 14772 does not distinguish between discrete events (such as those
generated by a TouchSensor) and events that are the result of sampling a
conceptually continuous set of changes (such as the fraction events generated
by a TimeSensor). An ideal VRML implementation would generate an infinite
number of samples for continuous changes, each of which would be processed
infinitely quickly.</P>

<P>Before processing a discrete event, all continuous changes that are occurring
at the discrete event's timestamp shall behave as if they generate events
at that same timestamp.</P>

<P>Beyond the requirements that continuous changes be up-to-date during
the processing of discrete changes, the sampling frequency of continuous
changes is implementation dependent. Typically a TimeSensor affecting a
visible (or otherwise perceptible) portion of the world will generate events
once per <I>frame</I>, where a frame is a single rendering of the world
or one time-step in a simulation.</P>

<H3><A NAME="4.12.1"></A>4.12.1 Introduction</H3>

<P>Authors often require that VRML worlds change dynamically in response
to user inputs, external events, and the current state of the world. The
proposition &quot;if the vault is currently closed AND the correct combination
is entered, open the vault&quot; illustrates the type of problem which may
need addressing. These kinds of decisions are expressed as Script nodes
(see <A HREF="nodesRef.html#Script">6.40, Script</A>) that receive events
from other nodes, process them, and send events to other nodes. A Script
node can also keep track of information between subsequent executions (i.e.,&nbsp;retaining
internal state over time).</P>

<P>This subclause describes the general mechanisms and semantics of all
scripting language access protocols. Note that no scripting language is
required by ISO/IEC 14772. Details for two scripting languages are in <A
HREF="java.html">annex&nbsp;B,&nbsp;Java&nbsp;platform scripting&nbsp;reference</A>,
and <A HREF="javascript.html">annex&nbsp;C,&nbsp;ECMAScript&nbsp;scripting&nbsp;reference</A>,
respectively. If either of these scripting languages are implemented, the
Script node implementation shall conform with the definition described in
the corresponding annex.</P>

<P>Event processing is performed by a program or script contained in (or
referenced by) the Script node's <I>url</I> field. This program or script
may be written in any programming language that the browser supports.</P>

<H3><A NAME="4.12.2"></A>4.12.2 Script execution</H3>

<P>A Script node is activated when it receives an event. The browser shall
then execute the program in the Script node's <I>url</I> field (passing
the program to an external interpreter if necessary). The program can perform
a wide variety of actions including sending out events (and thereby changing
the scene), performing calculations, and communicating with servers elsewhere
on the Internet. A detailed description of the ordering of event processing
is contained in <A HREF="#4.10">4.10, Event processing</A>.</P>

<P>Script nodes may also be executed after they are created (see <A HREF=
"#4.12.3">4.12.3, Initialize() and shutdown()</A>). Some scripting languages
may allow the creation of separate processes from scripts, resulting in
continuous execution (see <A HREF="#4.12.6">4.12.6, Asynchronous scripts</A>).</P>

<P>Script nodes receive events in timestamp order. Any events generated
as a result of processing an event are given timestamps corresponding to
the event that generated them. Conceptually, it takes no time for a Script
node to receive and process an event, even though in practice it does take
some amount of time to execute a Script.</P>

<P>When a <I>set_url</I> event is received by a Script node that contains
a script that has been previously initialized for a different URL, the <I>shutdown()</I>
method of the current script is called (see&nbsp;<A HREF="#4.12.3">4.12.3,&nbsp;Initialize()
and shutdown()</A>). Until the new script becomes available, the script
shall behave as though it has no executable content. When the new script
becomes available, the <I>Initialize()</I> method is invoked as defined
in <A HREF="#4.10.3">4.10.3,&nbsp;Execution&nbsp;model</A>. The limiting
case is when the URL contains inline code that can be immediately executed
upon receipt of the <I>set_url</I> event (e.g.,&nbsp;javascript: protocol).
In this case, it can be assumed that the old code is unloaded and the new
code loaded instantaneously, after any dynamic route requests have been
performed. <BR>
</P>

<H3><A NAME="4.12.3"></A>4.12.3 <I>Initialize()</I> and <I>shutdown()</I></H3>

<P>The scripting language binding may define an <I>initialize()</I> method.
This method shall be invoked before the browser presents the world to the
user and before any events are processed by any nodes in the same VRML file
as the Script node containing this script. Events generated by the <I>initialize()</I>
method shall have timestamps less than any other events generated by the
Script node. This allows script initialization tasks to be performed prior
to the user interacting with the world.</P>

<P>Likewise, the scripting language binding may define a <I>shutdown()</I>
method. This method shall be invoked when the corresponding Script node
is deleted or the world containing the Script node is unloaded or replaced
by another world. This method may be used as a clean-up operation, such
as informing external mechanisms to remove temporary files. No other methods
of the script may be invoked after the <I>shutdown()</I> method has completed,
though the <I>shutdown()</I> method may invoke methods or send events while
shutting down. Events generated by the <I>shutdown()</I> method that are
routed to nodes that are being deleted by the same action that caused the
<I>shutdown()</I> method to execute will not be delivered. The deletion
of the Script node containing the <I>shutdown()</I> method is not complete
until the execution of its <I>shutdown()</I> method is complete.</P>

<H3><A NAME="4.12.4"></A>4.12.4 <I>EventsProcessed()</I></H3>

<P>The scripting language binding may define an <I>eventsProcessed()</I>
method that is called after one or more events are received. This method
allows Scripts that do not rely on the order of events received to generate
fewer events than an equivalent Script that generates events whenever events
are received. If it is used in some other time-dependent way, <I>eventsProcessed()</I>
may be nondeterministic, since different browser implementations may call
<I>eventsProcessed()</I> at different times.</P>

<P>For a single event cascade, a given Script node's eventsProcessed method
shall be called at most once. Events generated from an <I>eventsProcessed()</I>
method are given the timestamp of the last event processed.</P>

<H3><A NAME="4.12.5"></A>4.12.5 Scripts with direct outputs</H3>

<P>Scripts that have access to other nodes (via SFNode/MFNode fields or
eventIns) and that have their <I>directOutput</I> field set to TRUE may
directly post eventIns to those nodes. They may also read the last value
sent from any of the node's eventOuts.</P>

<P>When setting a value in another node, implementations are free to either
immediately set the value or to defer setting the value until the Script
is finished. When getting a value from another node, the value returned
shall be up-to-date; that is, it shall be the value immediately before the
time of the current timestamp (the current timestamp returned is the timestamp
of the event that caused the Script node to execute).</P>

<P>If multiple <I>directOutput</I> Scripts read from and/or write to the
same node, the results are undefined.</P>

<H3><A NAME="4.12.6"></A>4.12.6 Asynchronous scripts</H3>

<P>Some languages supported by VRML browsers may allow Script nodes to spontaneously
generate events, allowing users to create Script nodes that function like
new Sensor nodes. In these cases, the Script is generating the initial events
that causes the event cascade, and the scripting language and/or the browser
shall determine an appropriate timestamp for that initial event. Such events
are then sorted into the event stream and processed like any other event,
following all of the same rules including those for looping.</P>

<H3><A NAME="4.12.7"></A>4.12.7 Script languages</H3>

<P>The Script node's <I>url</I> field may specify a URL which refers to
a file (e.g.,&nbsp;using protocol http:) or incorporates scripting language
code directly in-line. The MIME-type of the returned data defines the language
type. Additionally, instructions can be included in-line using <A HREF=
"#4.5.4">4.5.4,&nbsp;Scripting&nbsp;language&nbsp;protocol</A>, defined
for the specific language (from which the language type is inferred).</P>

<P>For example, the following Script node has one eventIn field named <I>start</I>
and three different URL values specified in the <I>url</I> field: Java,
ECMAScript, and inline ECMAScript:</P>

<PRE>
<B>    Script {</B>
<B>      eventIn SFBool start</B>
<B>      url [ &quot;http://foo.com/fooBar.class&quot;,</B>
<B>        &quot;http://foo.com/fooBar.js&quot;,</B>
<B>        &quot;javascript:function start(value, timestamp) { ... }&quot;</B>
    <B>  ]</B>
<B>    }</B></PRE>

<P>In the above example when a <I>start</I> eventIn is received by the Script
node, one of the scripts found in the <I>url</I> field is executed. The
Java platform bytecode is the first choice, the ECMAScript code is the second
choice, and the inline ECMAScript code the third choice. A description of
order of preference for multiple valued URL fields may be found in <A HREF=
"#4.5.2">4.5.2, URLs</A>.</P>

<H3><A NAME="4.12.8"></A>4.12.8 EventIn handling</H3>

<P>Events received by the Script node are passed to the appropriate scripting
language method in the script. The method's name depends on the language
type used. In some cases, it is identical to the name of the eventIn; in
others, it is a general callback method for all eventIns (see the scripting
language annexes for details). The method is passed two arguments: the event
value and the event timestamp.</P>

<H3><A NAME="4.12.9"></A>4.12.9 Accessing fields and events</H3>

<P>The fields, eventIns, and eventOuts of a Script node are accessible from
scripting language methods. Events can be routed to eventIns of Script nodes
and the eventOuts of Script nodes can be routed to eventIns of other nodes.
Another Script node with access to this node can access the eventIns and
eventOuts just like any other node (see <A HREF="#4.12.5">4.12.5, Scripts
with direct outputs</A>).</P>

<P>It is recommended that user-defined field or event names defined in Script
nodes follow the naming conventions described in <A HREF="#4.7">4.7,&nbsp;Field,
eventIn,&nbsp;and eventOut semantics</A>.</P>

<H4>4.12.9.1 Accessing fields and eventOuts of the script</H4>

<P>Fields defined in the Script node are available to the script through
a language-specific mechanism (e.g.,&nbsp;a variable is automatically defined
for each field and event of the Script node). The field values can be read
or written and are persistent across method calls. EventOuts defined in
the Script node may also be read; the returned value is the last value sent
to that eventOut.</P>

<H4>4.12.9.2 Accessing eventIns and eventOuts of other nodes</H4>

<P>The script can access any eventIn or eventOut of any node to which it
has access. The syntax of this mechanism is language dependent. The following
example illustrates how a Script node accesses and modifies an exposed field
of another node (i.e.,&nbsp;sends a <I>set_translation</I> eventIn to the
Transform node) using ECMAScript:</P>

<PRE>
<B>    DEF SomeNode Transform { }</B>
<B>    Script {</B>
<B>      field   SFNode  tnode USE SomeNode</B>
<B>      eventIn SFVec3f pos</B>
    <B>  directOutput TRUE</B>
<B>      url &quot;javascript:</B>
<B>        function pos(value, timestamp) {</B>
<B>          tnode.set_translation = value;</B>
<B>        }&quot;</B>
<B>    }</B></PRE>

<P>The language-dependent mechanism for accessing eventIns or eventOuts
(or the eventIn or eventOut part of an exposedField) shall support accessing
them without their &quot;<I>set_&quot;</I> or &quot;<I>_changed</I>&quot;
prefix or suffix, to match the ROUTE statement semantics. When accessing
an eventIn named &quot;<I>zzz</I>&quot; and an eventIn of that name is not
found, the browser shall try to access the eventIn named &quot;<I>set_zzz</I>&quot;.
Similarly, if accessing an eventOut named &quot;<I>zzz</I>&quot; and an
eventOut of that name is not found, the browser shall try to access the
eventOut named &quot;<I>zzz_changed</I>&quot;.</P>

<H4><A NAME="4.12.9.3"></A>4.12.9.3 Sending eventOuts</H4>

<P>Each scripting language provides a mechanism for allowing scripts to
send a value through an eventOut defined by the Script node. For example,
one scripting language may define an explicit method for sending each eventOut,
while another language may use assignment statements to automatically defined
eventOut variables to implicitly send the eventOut. Sending multiple values
through an eventOut during a single script execution will result in the
&quot;last&quot; event being sent, where &quot;last&quot; is determined
by the semantics of the scripting language being used.</P>

<H3><A NAME="4.12.10"></A>4.12.10 Browser script interface</H3>

<H4>4.12.10.1 Introduction</H4>

<P>The browser interface provides a mechanism for scripts contained by Script
nodes to get and set browser state (e.g.,&nbsp;the URL of the current world).
This subclause describes the semantics of methods that the browser interface
supports. An arbitrary syntax is used to define the type of parameters and
returned values. The specific annex for a language contains the actual syntax
required. In this abstract syntax, types are given as VRML field types.
Mapping of these types into those of the underlying language (as well as
any type conversion needed) is described in the appropriate language annex.</P>

<H4>4.12.10.2 SFString getName( ) and SFString getVersion( )</H4>

<P>The <B>getName()</B> and <B>getVersion()</B> methods return a string
representing the &quot;name&quot; and &quot;version&quot; of the browser
currently in use. These values are defined by the browser writer, and identify
the browser in some (unspecified) way. They are not guaranteed to be unique
or to adhere to any particular format and are for information only. If the
information is unavailable these methods return empty strings.</P>

<H4>4.12.10.3 SFFloat getCurrentSpeed( )</H4>

<P>The <B>getCurrentSpeed()</B> method returns the average navigation speed
for the currently bound <A HREF="nodesRef.html#NavigationInfo">NavigationInfo</A>
node in meters per second, in the coordinate system of the currently bound
<A HREF="nodesRef.html#Viewpoint">Viewpoint</A> node. If speed of motion
is not meaningful in the current navigation type, or if the speed cannot
be determined for some other reason, 0.0 is returned.</P>

<H4>4.12.10.4 SFFloat getCurrentFrameRate( )</H4>

<P>The <B>getCurrentFrameRate()</B> method returns the current frame rate
in frames per second. The way in which frame rate is measured and whether
or not it is supported at all is browser dependent. If frame rate measurement
is not supported or cannot be determined, 0.0 is returned.</P>

<H4>4.12.10.5 SFString getWorldURL( )</H4>

<P>The <B>getWorldURL()</B> method returns the URL for the root of the currently
loaded world.</P>

<H4>4.12.10.6 void replaceWorld( MFNode nodes )</H4>

<P>The <B>replaceWorld()</B> method replaces the current world with the
world represented by the passed nodes. An invocation of this method will
usually not return since the world containing the running script is being
replaced. Scripts that may call this method shall have <I>mustEvaluate</I>
set to TRUE.</P>

<H4>4.12.10.7 void loadURL( MFString url, MFString parameter )</H4>

<P>The <B>loadURL()</B> method loads the first recognized URL from the specified<I>
url</I> field with the passed parameters. The <I>parameter</I> and <I>url</I>
arguments are treated identically to the Anchor node's <I>parameter</I>
and <I>url</I> fields (see <A HREF="nodesRef.html#Anchor">6.2,&nbsp;Anchor</A>).
This method returns immediately. However, if the URL is loaded into this
browser window (e.g.,&nbsp;there is no TARGET parameter to redirect it to
another frame), the current world will be terminated and replaced with the
data from the specified URL at some time in the future. Scripts that may
call this method shall set <I>mustEvaluate</I> to TRUE. If <B>loadUrl()</B>
is invoked with a URL of the form &quot;#name&quot;, the Viewpoint node
with the given name (&quot;name&quot;) in the Script' node's run-time name
scope(s) shall be bound. However, if the Script node containing the script
that invokes <B>loadURL(&quot;#name&quot;)</B> is not part of any run-time
name scope or is part of more than one run-time name scope, results are
undefined. See <A HREF="#4.4.6">4.4.6,&nbsp;Run-time&nbsp;name&nbsp;scope</A>,
for a description of run-time name scope.</P>

<H4>4.12.10.8 void setDescription( SFString description )</H4>

<P>The <B>setDescription()</B> method sets the passed string as the current
description. This message is displayed in a browser dependent manner. An
empty string clears the current description. Scripts that call this method
shall have <I>mustEvaluate</I> set to TRUE.</P>

<H4><A NAME="4.12.10.9"></A>4.12.10.9 MFNode createVrmlFromString( SFString
vrmlSyntax )</H4>

<P>The <B>createVrmlFromString</B>() method parses a string consisting of
VRML statements, establishes any PROTO and EXTERNPROTO declarations and
routes, and returns an MFNode value containing the set of nodes in those
statements. The string shall be self-contained (i.e.,&nbsp;USE statements
inside the string may refer only to nodes DEF'ed in the string, and non-built-in
node types used by the string shall be prototyped using EXTERNPROTO or PROTO
statements inside the string).</P>

<H4>4.12.10.10 void createVrmlFromURL( MFString url, SFNode node, SFString
event )</H4>

<P>The <B>createVrmlFromURL()</B> instructs the browser to load a VRML scene
description from the given URL or URLs. The VRML file referred to shall
be self-contained (i.e.,&nbsp;USE statements inside the string may refer
only to nodes DEF'ed in the string, and non-built-in node types used by
the string shall be prototyped using EXTERNPROTO or PROTO statements inside
the string). After the scene is loaded, <I>event</I> is sent to the passed
<I>node</I> returning the root nodes of the corresponding VRML scene. The
<I>event</I> parameter contains a string naming an MFNode eventIn on the
passed node.</P>

<H4>4.12.10.11 void addRoute(...) and void deleteRoute(...)</H4>

<H4>void addRoute( SFNode fromNode, SFString fromEventOut,<BR>

<P>These methods respectively add and delete a route between the given event
names for the given nodes. Scripts that call this method shall have <I>directOutput</I>
set to TRUE. Routes that are added and deleted shall obey the execution
order defined in <A HREF="#4.10.3">4.10.3,&nbsp;Execution&nbsp;model</A>.</P>

<H3><A NAME="4.13.1"></A>4.13.1 Introduction</H3>

<P>Conceptually speaking, every VRML world contains a <I>viewpoint </I>from
which the world is currently being viewed. Navigation is the action taken
by the user to change the position and/or orientation of this viewpoint
thereby changing the user's view. This allows the user to move through a
world or examine an object. The NavigationInfo node (see <A HREF="nodesRef.html#NavigationInfo">6.29,&nbsp;NavigationInfo</A>)
specifies the characteristics of the desired navigation behaviour, but the
exact user interface is browser-dependent. The Viewpoint node (see <A HREF=
"nodesRef.html#Viewpoint">6.53,&nbsp;Viewpoint</A>) specifies key locations
and orientations in the world to which the user may be moved via scripts
or browser-specific user interfaces.</P>

<H3><A NAME="4.13.2"></A>4.13.2 Navigation paradigms</H3>

<P>The browser may allow the user to modify the location and orientation
of the viewer in the virtual world using a navigation paradigm. Many different
navigation paradigms are possible, depending on the nature of the virtual
world and the task the user wishes to perform. For instance, a walking paradigm
would be appropriate in an architectural walkthrough application, while
a flying paradigm might be better in an application exploring interstellar
space. Examination is another common use for VRML, where the world is considered
to be a single object which the user wishes to view from many angles and
distances.</P>

<P>The NavigationInfo node has a <I>type</I> field that specifies the navigation
paradigm for this world. The actual user interface provided to accomplish
this navigation is browser-dependent. See <A HREF="nodesRef.html#NavigationInfo">6.29,&nbsp;NavigationInfo</A>,
for details.</P>

<H3><A NAME="4.13.3"></A>4.13.3 Viewing model</H3>

<P>The browser controls the location and orientation of the viewer in the
world, based on input from the user (using the browser-provided navigation
paradigm) and the motion of the currently bound Viewpoint node (and its
coordinate system). The VRML author can place any number of viewpoints in
the world at important places from which the user might wish to view the
world. Each viewpoint is described by a <A HREF="nodesRef.html#Viewpoint">Viewpoint</A>
node. Viewpoint nodes exist in their parent's coordinate system, and both
the viewpoint and the coordinate system may be changed to affect the view
of the world presented by the browser. Only one viewpoint is bound at a
time. A detailed description of how the Viewpoint node operates is described
in <A HREF="#4.6.10">4.6.10,&nbsp;Bindable&nbsp;children&nbsp;nodes</A>,
and <A HREF="nodesRef.html#Viewpoint">6.53,&nbsp;Viewpoint</A>.</P>

<P>Navigation is performed relative to the Viewpoint's location and does
not affect the location and orientation values of a Viewpoint node. The
location of the viewer may be determined with a ProximitySensor node (see
<A HREF="nodesRef.html#ProximitySensor">6.38,&nbsp;ProximitySensor</A>).</P>

<H3><A NAME="4.13.4"></A>4.13.4 Collision detection and terrain following</H3>

<P>A VRML file can contain Collision nodes (see <A HREF="nodesRef.html#Collision">6.8,&nbsp;Collision</A>)
and NavigationInfo nodes that influence the browser's navigation paradigm.
The browser is responsible for detecting collisions between the viewer and
the objects in the virtual world, and is also responsible for adjusting
the viewer's location when a collision occurs. Browsers shall not disable
collision detection except for the special cases listed below. Collision
nodes can be used to generate events when viewer and objects collide, and
can be used to designate that certain objects should be treated as transparent
to collisions. Support for inter-object collision is not specified. The
NavigationInfo types of WALK, FLY, and NONE shall strictly support collision
detection. However, the NavigationInfo types ANY and EXAMINE may temporarily
disable collision detection during navigation, but shall not disable collision
detection during the normal execution of the world. See <A HREF="nodesRef.html#NavigationInfo">6.29,&nbsp;NavigationInfo</A>,
for details on the various navigation types.</P>

<P>NavigationInfo nodes can be used to specify certain parameters often
used by browser navigation paradigms. The size and shape of the viewer's
avatar determines how close the avatar may be to an object before a collision
is considered to take place. These parameters can also be used to implement
<I>terrain following</I> by keeping the avatar a certain distance above
the ground. They can additionally be used to determine how short an object
must be for the viewer to automatically step up onto it instead of colliding
with it.</P>

<P>The VRML lighting model provides detailed equations which define the
colours to apply to each geometric object. For each object, the values of
the Material node, Color node and texture currently being applied to the
object are combined with the lights illuminating the object and the currently
bound Fog node. These equations are designed to simulate the physical properties
of light striking a surface.</P>
