<P>There's another strange phenomenon in the vCity.  Some people like to register more than once as different people.  In the vCity, multiple personality is not a disorder.  Under the rules of the simulation, it's perfectly legal; as long as each vCitizen registers and maintains a valid Internet address, there is nothing to prevent one person from becoming more than one vCitizen.  Of course, that's a rather complicated proposition, and sometimes can be expensive -- each vCitizen has one and only one e-mail account.
<P>On the subject of names, by the way, we supplied some basic filters to screen out the obvious English, Spanish, and Japanese obscenities.  However, we recognized even before the simulation hit the Internet back in '97 that there was no good way to prevent people from doing sophomoric things with their names.  So we got even with them, and forced them to stick with their names.  I must say, that had quite the desired effect.  It may seem funny at first to have a name like Phuck Ewe, but have you ever tried to live with it day in, day out?  People e-mailing you as "Phuck Ewe?"  Ever try to send a serious salutation ending with "Phuck Ewe?"  It just doesn't work.  No one who tries it sticks with it.  Sometimes there is great wisdom in laissez faire.
<P>I know one Mole rat who, at last count, is 13 different people of different genders, races, and income levels.  This kid alone must have built about 5% of the Belowtown tunnels.  Is it fair to allow one person to vote more than once on the same issue?  No, of course not.  However, we decided to allow it on the grounds that we had no idea how to prevent it.  Also, we felt that if someone were to go through all the time and trouble to maintain independent IP addresses and participate in the building of the vCity, they should at least earn the right to proportional representation in vCity affairs.
<P>One of her names is Mole Queen, I've e-corresponded with her over the last few years.  She's learned more about society and technology than any eleven-year-old I've ever known, and knows more than most people ever will.
<P>I have often wondered about kids like this.  What kind of girl spends most of her life in a fantasy world?  I am sometimes tempted to tell her to get a real life, but four things always catch me short of doing so.  First of all, it would be hypocritical -- I can see her saying to me with baleful eyes, "<I>You</I> spend your time in the vCity, why can't I?"  Although I get paid for doing so.  Secondly, what child, girl or boy, does <I>not</I> live at least part of the time in a fantasy world?  Dimly I can remember back to my own childhood and it seems that a good part of it was make-believe.  It just wasn't electronic fantasy, but it was still a shadow world where truth could be found if one knew where to look.  Thirdly, I figure time and hormones will take care of things.  There is a basic drive, even in the Chairborn, to get out, run around, and rut.  Finally, who am I to say why my little friend has retreated to the shadow world of the Internet?  I don't really know her circumstances.  Maybe she is abused or unhappy or friendless in reality, but finds solace, respect, and thousands of friends on the Internet.  She, who has built the vCity more than many, should at least have the right to 13 lousy votes.
<P>I don't begrudge her the right to her sunless existence.  Mole Queen and the rest of the New Millennites will need skills and knowledge to survive; and one day she will become a great leader of the new world disorder.  So let it be written; so let it be done.
