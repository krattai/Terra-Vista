<P>The vCity International Airport is a very cool techsimm because it is based on work sponsored by the U.S. DOT (Department of Transportation) in the 1990s.  As a matter of fact, our corporation and a few DOT contractors got together to design the thing.  We donated the server space and some additional software, and they put in the creative hours and the ideas.
<P>They designed a beyond-the-state-of-the-art facility that features highly automated air control systems, grounds and building maintenance, environmental control, security, and baggage and cargo handling.  The entire design of every aspect of the airport is geared towards ease of maintenance and repair, except where such considerations would compromise passenger safety.  For example, the runways are constructed of "intelligent" silicate/ceramic inlaid concrete.  Which means that cracks are self-repairing, and the runways "sense" when they need to heat, cool, or "wrinkle" themselves according to weather conditions and traffic use.  (The wrinkles, by the way, act as anti-skid devices for wet or icy surface conditions)
<P>Upon debarking and/or entering the airport, each visitor receives a small oblong token called a PIT or Personal Identification Tag.  (Harmless if eaten, incidentally)  At any of innumerable PIT STOPS, a visitor can enter information or requests for information about flight schedules and delays, ticketing, insurance, weather conditions and other information at point of destination, and available facilities at the airport including infant & child care centers, medical care centers, shopping, restaurants and eateries, exercise & entertainment, sleeping quarters, relaxation centers, conference center facilities, etcetera.  These information kiosks "intelligently" steer people to where they need to be and offers such niceties as reminding people to catch their flights.  PITs deactivate after a while and become nice little collectible souvenirs.
<P>There is more that the average tourist never sees, because after wandering around the techsimm for a while, they usually <I>beam</I> over to <A HREF="cityce01.htm">City Centre</A> or to the S & E Complex.  However, for those who take the time to explore the airport in its entirety -- and I suppose you have to be a real aircraft enthusiast to get into this stuff -- there are some nifty explanations of how the vCity air transportation system works.
<P>The vCity Aircraft Transportation Information Subcenter provides continually updated information about air traffic conditions to all types of aircraft including: fixed-wing, swing-wing, adjustable-tilt rotary engine, fixed rotary blade, glider, and dirigible.  In short, just about any manufactured object that flies under piloted or nolopilot control.
<P>There are <I>six</I> airports, airparks, and hangars located throughout the area, all accessible by light rail with stations located for convenient all-weather-conditions transfer directly to gates and waiting areas.  All such facilities are constructed, managed, and operated by private corporate consortiums (simmcorps).  There is a Regional Airport, and a Light Aircraft Airport.  The vCity Helicopter and VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) Pad Complex, called simply the "H and V" by its users, services aircraft using small pads only.  The complex is, effectively, a huge metered parking lot that coordinates vertical traffic in and around the immediate vicinity.  The H and V is an important staging area between Plasteel Canyon and the rest of the vCity regions, especially the outlying piedmont and mountains where there is no light rail connection.  The H and V also serves as an important cargo staging area between industrial sites in outlying regions, and the heavy rail cargo and spaceport areas.
<P>The Ultra-Light Aircraft and Hangglider Airpark is not an airport, but really almost more of an adjunct to the Sports & Entertainment Complex.  Indeed, several of the "U and H" facilities are actually owned and operated by members of the Good Luck Cartel.  Anyway, this facility services personal aircraft of engine- and human-powered varieties, and it is located not too far away from the Updraft Junction, that is, the area that lay between The Canyon and Volcano Slopes which provides the nearly constant upbuffets beloved by personal aircraft enthusiasts.  This is a dangerous traffic zone, what with all the gliders and ultra-lights dodging each other and trying to avoid hitting avatars and bird scapps.  Finally, there is also a Dirigible and Balloon Hangar Complex.
