<P>The vCity International Airport is not only a techsimm.  Within the larger Zoning Volume there are places where real corporations have set up a VR shop.  I notice that most major U.S. air carriers and many foreign national carriers have established links here.  Clicking on one of the booths, I find myself in a 2D HTML-based environment -- a web page -- where I can order real tickets or obtain information on real travel schedules and frequent flier programs.
<P>Oops.  Back to the virtual reality, please.
<P>The vCity International Airport is the busiest airport in the world.  In 2001 it handled more than three hundred million visitors. Checking the data, I see that flow through has increased by 1% in the first three weeks of June.  That means we're on target for something like a 20% increase for the year.  That's just measuring the people coming through that gateway.  The seaport handles some of the other inflow.
<P>We really don't know exactly how many tourists the vCity gets every year.  Once people have visited the vCity, they usually just <I>beam</I> to where they want to go, even though strictly speaking they should become vCitizens in order to do that.  However, in the vCity world, there is no such thing as an illegal immigrant.  You either become a vCitizen or you don't.  If you do, you register your IP address and stake a claim to a Zoning Volume.  If you don't, you're a welcome guest, and as we point out in the intro, "Stay as long as you please, and come back as often as you like!"
