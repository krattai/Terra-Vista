<P>All of this was irrelevant, however, to the larger concern over how "telecommuting" affected the economy.  Local, state, and federal governments everywhere were very interested in determining what it all meant.  More millions of dollars were distributed -- presumably to those consultants who hadn't yet received grants or contracts -- and the results conclusively proved that change causes winners and losers.  No one was wiped clean off the map; "telecommuting" merely caused a redistribution of revenue flow, as if a minor earthquake had caused a river to alter its course, ultimately draining some swamps and flooding a few fields.
<P>Commercial real estate, for example, dropped some in value.  Whether this is because it had been oversupplied in the 1980s and 1990s or because demand for traditional office space really did fade is difficult to say.  The hardest hit sectors were the classic city centers stuffed with commercial property -- the so-called 'miracle mile' of many a metropolis -- and little else.  Parking lots and "9 to 5" delicatessens catering to the suit-and-tie crowd lost business.  Caterers, building maintenance services, florists, shoe-shines -- they all lost business.
<P>Bankers, investors, owners, and revenue agents began to get edgy, but very few panicked.  The reason why is that they had time to adjust.  In the marketplace of money and ideas, technical and social innovation more often produces dents than holes.  "Telecommuting" was a powerful reality, but it was not the sledge-hammer that some had predicted it would be.  Rather, it was millions of ball-peen hammers capable of sculpting a new form out of the steel-reinforced concrete of urban civilization.
<P>Most real estate companies were invested in residential and "mixed" zoning estate, so the effects of a deflation in commercial value proved to be negligible.  Construction workers and architects who specialized in commercial high-risers moved to different projects.  There was still a market for refurbishing older, existing buildings.  As for lost revenue to city governments, a simple zoning change allowed commercial property to become a hybrid of commercial and residential, so that people could work and live in the same building.  That dampened enthusiasm for telecommuting, since some of its benefits relative to traditional commuting evaporated when the latter itself changed.
<P>The biggest winners were those companies who specialized in providing telecommuting services.  Why this should have come as a surprise is beyond the ken of any rational observer.  Some people overlook the obvious in their search for the obscure, I suppose.  What was not clearly stated (nor generally predicted), however, was that the capital for the telecommuting industry came from the same banks, investors, and owners who previously had a stake in the traditional commuting industry.
<P>The most blatant example I can think of was the mass transit systems of many larger cities in Europe.  The Dutch and Belgians pioneered the "if you can't beat 'em, join 'em" approach.  Noticing that their ridership was falling off, no longer able to raid general revenue funding, and unwilling to raise ridership fees for fear of aggravating their loss in riders, they simply invested in mass electronic transit instead.  In Amsterdam, for example, the metro is also the single largest stake-holder of cable-and-fiber connection firms in the city.  Far from treating "telecommuting" as a rising tide to be sandbagged, they have embraced it as a vertical extension of the transportation industry.  By clever use of advertising and promotional tie-ins -- for example, mailing free metro passes to customers who sign on with specific Internet access providers -- they have maximized revenue for both.
