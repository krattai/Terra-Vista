<P>Take the Hedley Koor corporation as an example.  HK Industries was a California-based firm that earned most of its business from maintenance contracts on U.S. Air Force Air Bases.  One of the things it did was mow and trim grass around USAF facilities.  Now, this may sound like a very arcane subspecialty, but there is a body of literature -- U.S. government contract specifications -- on how grass must be cut.  Violations can be punished, especially by contract officers desperate to meet budget cuts and forego such things as award fees or even invoice payments.  So HKI Inc. was very interested in making sure that USAF lawns were cut exactly to specs.
<P>To cut grass with inhuman precision, one cannot use humans.  HKI Inc. pioneered in the use of robotic lawn mowers.  In the beginning, these were gasoline-powered machines that operated autonomously with laser-range finders, gyros, a locality positioning system, and a host of AI programming.  They were tremendously expensive to design, program, and build; however, their life-cycle costs over thirty years were estimated to be cheaper than using people to the job, considering total costs including human health care, insurance, benefits, pensions, and work-related "interruptions".
<P>When HKI Inc. tried to market the same technology to the private sector, however, it was a miserable failure.  No one wanted a Terminator-like lawn mower running around with the spectre of it chasing down and eliminating Fido in a mistaken object-analysis routine.  The corporation took great pains to assure people that this was not possible; but the people, in their infinite wisdom, disagreed.  I do not know the truth.
<P>At any rate, by 1998 HKI Inc. was desperate to transfer something -- <I>anything</I>  -- of its expertise to the marketplace.  That was when the vCity was in first bloom.  Some of the HKI Inc. engineers familiar with VR programming set up a simmcorp in the vCity just for fun, without permission from their superiors.  Marketing caught on, and began to ask people questions through the vCity.  What kind of lawn mower did the people want, anyway?
<P>vCitizens at that time were predominantly well-to-do, homeowning, North American males age 35+.  This is not a representative cross-section of the planetary population, however it was <I>precisely</I> the market which might be interested in something as ridiculous as a robotic lawn mower.
<P>HKI Inc. was thrilled.  They learned first of all that people did not want autonomous technology, but remote-controlled machinery was okay.  From a programming point of view, this was actually easier to design.  They learned that people did not want gasoline-powered lawn mowers because they were noisy, smelly, required maintenance, violated some local ordinances, and because most lawns were just not big enough to require the speed and power afforded by an internal combustion engine.  They learned that electric-powered mowers that needed to be connected to an outlet were unpopular because the cord tends to wrap around trees or snag on other obstacles.  They learned many other things.  And HKI Inc. found a ready group of test-marketers.
<P>The result, to make a long story short, was the introduction of the nolomower.  It is a rechargeable battery (RB) driven device good for two hours of uninterrupted operation at approximately 8 h.p.  Linked by wireless comm to a special device that connects to the telephone, and from there to the Internet, it can be remotely operated as if it were a virtual reality construct by PC or HMD from anywhere on the globe.  Operation is, of course, keyed to an individual personal identification number (PIN) so that no one can do any unauthorized grass cutting.
<P>You would think that this piece of technology would have been laughed out of existence the moment it was introduced to the market.  That, however, is pre-vCity thinking.  HKI Inc. would never have introduced it in the first place had they not tested it quite carefully in a VR setting first, and if they had not established a rapport with their clientele prior to DDT&E.
<P>In fact, it proved enormously popular not only with men, but also with women.  The nolomower was a great success because people could operate it while doing something else, for example, sorting laundry or watching television.  The thing has a simple "deadman's clutch" that prevents it from moving when it is not being controlled.
