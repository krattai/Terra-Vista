<P>When the train comes to a stop, a semi-random number of passenger scapps exit through the train doors to the above-ground platform on the right hand side.  Scrolling out the doors, one sees a wonderful panorama unfold: the S&E Complex, kilometer after kilometer of verdant open tracts of golf courses, buildings of all kinds, stadiums, tracks, structures, lakes, climbing cliffs, parks, etcetera.  Here the sun always shines at high noon in a brilliant blue sky.  Cumulus cloud scapps roll ponderously by at an altitude of 5000 meters or so.  The occasional airplane or dirigible scapp drifts into and out of view.
<P>The S&E Complex, or just "S and E" as it is called by both the beer-swilling masses from Dawn Row and the champagne-sipping elite from Houghty, is a sports and entertainment village the likes of which has never been seen.  Owned and operated by a consortium of private vendors called the Good Luck Cartel (GLC), the S & E features arenas and facilities for almost every kind of sport and entertainment known.  And many that did not formerly exist.
<P>The one exception being professional wrestling.  Very early on in the life of the vCity, when I was still feeling my vOats, I banned the site as "stupefying" after witnessing a demonstration match.  It seemed patently inferior to the Sumo wrestling site.  This blatant attempt at imposing my worldview upon the vCity was my first and only mistake; it caused a tsunami of e-mail, and I relented.  Thereafter, we always used the referendum process.  I learned my lesson.  I learned that only God could remove professional wrestling from civilization.  Anyway, what was funny about that site, in retrospect, was that many people agreed with me, and in the end, the site collapsed from neglect.  And in the five years since then, no one has tried to open a new one.
