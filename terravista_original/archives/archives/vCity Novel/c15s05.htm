<P>About twenty minutes after that call, I received another one.  Grand Central Station today.
<P>"Doctor Green?"
<P>"This is he."
<P>"Doctor, this is Reverend Wallach of the Coalition for Preservation of Family & Society.  Do you have a minute to talk?"
<P>"Sure."  I thought for a second, who?  What?  Then it hit me.  This was the Christine Wallach.  Executive Director for the CPFS, a religious alliance of Christians, Jews, and Moslems.  One of the most powerful political groups in North America with a membership list and organization larger than that of the National Weapons Association.  One of the most powerful women in all of North America.
<P>"Excellent.  I must say, Doctor, that I had a rather difficult time finding anyone in your corporation who would talk to me."
<P>"Well, they're just afraid of you, I guess."
<P>Her laughter pealed out over the phone clearly, as water might gush forth from a fountain.  "But you, Doctor, you're not afraid of me?"
<P>"I fear nothing but the judgment of the Almighty, Ms. Wallach."
<P>"Ah, well spoken."  She was all serious business.  "You're a God-fearing man, then?"
<P>"No.  I'm a God-loving man."
<P>"Ah.  Some would say they are one and the same.  Well, I must say, this surprises me.  I did not expect to find someone who spoke my language."
<P>"English?"
<P>"No, I meant . . . well, never mind.  How is it that you countenance what your corporation is doing?"
<P>"Let me guess.  In reference to our virtual city simulation?"
<P>"Yes.  How can you, of all people, allow such filth on the Internet?"
<P>"Ms. Wallach, filth was on the Internet long before I even had a job with this corporation.  Filth existed long before there was an Internet.  But anyway it's not a question of whether I should allow it or not.  Are you aware of our referendum process?"
<P>"Not precisely, no."
<P>"Well, in short, I don't tell people what they can see or not, I just call a referendum for the people to decide whether a particular site should be listed in our listings.  Think of our virtual city as a big Yellow Pages where the customers on the mailing list choose which phone numbers they want to be listed.   It's that simple."
<P>"Sometimes people don't always know what is right; they need guidance."
<P>"Like children?  I suppose that's true in some circumstances.  Almost all of the people who access the virtual city are over five years of age, however."
<P>"Why expose people to such perversion, though?  This is not something your corporation should be doing."
<P>"Even if we pulled the link, Ms. Wallach, the perversion would still be there."
<P>"But you don't have to make it easy for people.  You should pull the link."
<P>"I just got off the phone with Roberto Canseco.  He insisted that I <I>not</I> pull the link."
<P>"That man is the devil's spawn."
<P>"I wouldn't know."
<P>"We are very much against this," she warned.
<P>"Well then I have a suggestion for you.  And if you say the idea came from me, I'll deny it."
<P>A short pause.  "I'm listening."
<P>"The CPFS favors preservation of family and social values within the framework of democracy, right?"
<P>"Democracy.  Go on."
<P>"Okay, I'll take that as a yes.  So what you might consider doing is asking your membership to get on their computers and access the virtual city, and become citizens of the virtual city.  They would instantly have the right to vote on the referendum.  You could tell them all to vote yes in favor of <I>banning</I> the site."
<P>"Would that get rid of it?"
<P>"Well, it would give me the authority to remove the listing.  It would disappear from the virtual city.  But the files would still be available on the Internet."
<P>"But your corporation provides Internet access all around the globe, so how does that solve the problem?"
<P>"It doesn't," I said honestly.  "The problem isn't about technology but about morality, which is a bigger issue.  All I can do, to use your own words, is not make it easy for people.  Force them to go outside the virtual city using a different browser."
<P>"A what?"
<P>"Software.  In other words, make it inconvenient to switch from one pair of glasses to another.  Most people don't like doing that."
<P>"I see your point.  So what you're saying is, that we can affect the outcome through force of numbers?"
<P>"Yes."
<P>"Create a virtual City of God?"
<P>"Become the new St. Augustine, if you like."
<P>"It's an interesting idea, Doctor.  I'll consider it.  Thanks."
<P>"Don't thank <I>me</I>; it's <I>your</I> idea."
<P>She laughed.  "Right.  Well, thank you for your time.  God be with you."
