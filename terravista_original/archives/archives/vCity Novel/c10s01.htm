"The city of man, for all the width of its expansion throughout the world and for all the depth of its differences in this place and that, is a single community.  The simple truth is that the bond of a common nature makes all human beings one.  Nevertheless, each individual in this community is driven by his passions to pursue his private purposes.  Unfortunately, the objects of these purposes are such that no one person (let alone, the world community) can ever be wholly satisfied."

<P>Monday mornings are not quite so grim in a civilization in which one can work unshaven in pajamas.
<P>In the old days I used to waste two hours of my day getting to the office downtown and returning home in the evening.  So the corporation and I cut a deal.  In return for their spending some bucks on fancy equipment, an extra phone line, and an ISDN connection to my home office, I donate those 2 hours -- an extra 10 hours a week -- to the Empire.  They get an employee who works 50 hours a week for the same salary, their insurance costs go down, and they don't have to lease office space anymore.  I get to work unshaven in my pajamas, and the cats get to maintain their sleep-vigil on the coffee table next to me.  Everyone wins.  This public service announcement brought to you by the Internetworking Industries Association of North America.
<P>"Telecommuting" was an alloy and not pure gold.  Quite a few people discovered that they <I>liked</I> the routine of going someplace else -- away from the house, where they could often be sidetracked by mundane problems of child care, taking out the garbage, and the everpresent snacks lurking in the refrigerator.  For the undisciplined, such productivity sinks could wipe out any gains.
<P>In the decade from 1992-2002, corporations and governments did study after study and in the end, after dispensing many millions of dollars to needy consultants everywhere, determined that life contained tradeoffs.  Yes, people dicked off at home.  But people also goofed off at work, too.  Yes, institutions could create elaborate infrastructures to monitor employee behavior and carrot/stick them into higher productivity.  No, it didn't matter, because there is nothing more ingenious than the human mind attempting to avoid work it does not wish to do.  Resistance acts as an air bubble; press down on it, and it will move somewhere else.
