<P>	Confluencia was so named because it is the area of the vCity proper where the Three Rivers meet before flowing towards The Bay.  We could have named it Trois Rivers or Koblenz, but those names were already taken by real world cities.  Confluence seemed too harsh in its rational precision. "Confluencia" had mellifluence.
<P>	Most of my inspection tours are PC-based.  Very few sites are capable of full HMD (Head Mounted Display) and/or MSE (Multiple Sensory Environment) interactivity.  I could go that way if I wanted to, but it is too slow for inspection tours.  When I see something that warrants further investigation, I bookmark it and go back to it later.  There is always more to see, and always more than I can see.
<P>	Confluencia was designed to have a close-in, vaguely claustrophobic feel to it.  The point of reference for the area is the Fountain Circle.  I always lose my sense of direction about a block away from it, but I know the shops and stores in the area.  Once it was all open volume which we used to call "sponge."  Now it has hyperdensity, which we call "onion"  Within the volumes people set up subvolumes, like layers of an onion.
<P>	I scroll up a side alley and into one of the older sites.  I know the proprietor well, having e-talked with him before.  Actually I don't know for a fact that he is a <I>he</I>.  He registers as vCitizen Justin Thyme.
<P>	There is no reliable econdata on Thyme; he does not purchase from our corporate network, so we cannot produce a profile.  Network marketing anticipated that problem.  We can apply a probability program to his e-mail.  There is a 75% chance, SD5%, that he is male, and nearly a 100% certainty that he is U.S. or Canadian.  The irony being that knowing this, what do we know?  It turns out that the only real way to learn about someone is to talk with them over a reasonable period of time.  No one in marketing seemed to have anticipated this simple fact.  Managers -- the people who hire others -- could have told them this.  But the corporation sacrificed middle management on the altar of Productivity a long time ago.  So the freshouts, armed with their reductionist knowledge, are now more ignorant than ever.
<P>	The name of Thyme's establishment is <I>Sage Advice</I>.  The virtual hostess is a busty 3D scapp (self-contained application) named Rosemary.  Maybe Justin has a spice and herb fixation, I don't know.  More likely it's some in-joke from the 1960s.  Ah, mental note for marketing:  strong probability that proprietor for this site is 40+.  Secondary possibility: nostalgia buff.
<P>	<I>Sage Advice</I> is an entertainment center divided into a number of suites.  Rosemary asks one "what you'd like to do," and gives one a list of options from a menu.  Clicking on an option brings one to that suite directly.  Or, one can simply browse through the halls and floors of the building, looking at nameplates on doors.  Clicking on a nameplate brings up a description of what is going on inside.  Some doors are "locked" to visitors, and some have no nameplates at all.  Some suites have Transparency programs that allow one to observe what is going on "inside", in a mode called semi-interactivity.  In effect, it is similar to reading a transcript of a conversation or a closed-caption translation, only it is 3D.  (Early on, the 3D objects interfaces were called windows, but someone -- I forget who, I'd have to check the Archives on this one -- got a cease and desist letter from a certain corporation, so now we all call them Transparencies)
<P>	I haven't been to <I>Sage Advice</I> for almost six months real time, and I am astonished at how it has filled out.  I can remember when there was practically nothing here but a ZV (Zoning Volume) and Justin's architectural shell looked like a warehouse.  Rosemary was much flatter then.
<P>	"From sponge to onion" as we say in the vCity business, though.  A ZV is actually a bureaucratic entity, a registry of CCs (City Coordinates).  Some ZVs can encompass tens of thousands of CCs.  A ZV doesn't have to be a solid cube, however.  ZVs can be interlaced with others.  Hence, the term "sponge" to reflect the notion of a volume whose density is variable and which can "fill out" over time.
<P>	<I>Sage Advice</I> is actually a typical ZV, and works on the same principle as an office building ZV.  Opening a door to a suite functionally transfers one to another site and, possibly, another server somewhere else on Earth.  So when, on the third floor of the building, I find a lime green door with a silver nameplate marked <I>Exon Inspiration</I> and I "enter" the suite, I am transferred to a new location no longer under Justin's jurisdiction.  The CC may be inside of his ZV, but it is not necessarily registered to him.  He merely maintains the link.
<P>	<I>Exon Inspiration</I> turns out to be a very sophisticated site devoted to interactive, 3D pornography.  This is why browsing is necessary and intelligence is useful.  The suite was not listed by the ever-helpful and always smiling Rosemary scapp.  The name of the suite itself would not ordinarily trigger an anti-pornography seeker program.  In fact, to be curious at all about what lay beyond the green door, one would have to know what <I>Exon</I> meant.  Or in this case, who.
