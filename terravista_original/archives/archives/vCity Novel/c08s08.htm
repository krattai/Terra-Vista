<P>The Zoning Council agreed on the general principle that because the rivers and the sea are common heritage, their exploitation had to be balanced by preservation and enrichment.  The current political scheme of allowing free market forces to self-correct the environmental degradation and outright disasters that result from exploitation of water-based resources seemed dubious.  So we set up a vCity Sustainable Maritime Environment Information Center.  This is run by vCitizens themselves, who regulate the use of the techsimms of the Seaport Complex and Sailboat Marina, and who establish "do's and don'ts" for any vCitizen desiring to use the virtual water as a transportation medium.
<P>The SMEIC split into factions almost immediately and generated a tidal wave of e-mail seemingly on every issue.  Their animosities spilled over into other areas of vCity life and drenched everyone in the process.
<P>For example, overfishing.  Clearing away the seaweed of rhetoric, it seems evident that a fishing boat, or fleet, is a large capital investment designed to do basically one thing: <I>kill fish</I>.  Frankly, this is a tough technology to bend to multi-tasking.  Worse yet, fishing interests throughout the real world seem especially resistant to, uh, socio-economic conversion.
<P>The argument was: is commercial fishing sustainable?  Yes, said many, with proper planning and a willingness to reduce short-term profits for the sake of long-term stability.  The exploitation of river, coastal, and oceanic resources is not <I>a priori</I> evil, they argued.  It all depends upon the <I>means</I> by which such exploitation takes place, its <I>scale</I>, and the degree to which resources are replaced and renewed.  The Pisces Corporation (a simmcorp, Registry Protected) made a stab at it by showcasing in a VR setting how they could essentially convert their fishing fleet into fish breeders depending upon seasonal conditions.
<P>No, said others, commercial fishing is not sustainable nor is it desirable.
<P>I stepped into this once and only once when I encouraged designers to design watercraft that would not pollute, and sailors to engage in water-based activities that would not destroy or disrupt.  I suggested that steps in the right direction would include the use of fuel-cell driven engines, sails, and use of spectrum frequencies that would not disrupt fish and mammals.  I pointed out that aquaculture could be a highly efficient, easily sustainable, and reasonably environmentally friendly industry producing more food than the fishing industry ever dreamed of harvesting.  And people could invest in and offer a flotilla of water-based floating entertainment and education centers such as restaurants, casinos, hotels, aquariums, universities, etcetera.
<P>They all yelled at me to mind my own business; I went back to being a landlubber.
