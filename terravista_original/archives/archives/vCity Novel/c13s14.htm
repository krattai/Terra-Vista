<P>All hell broke loose when the Advanced Plasma Physics Laboratory in Princeton, N.J. set up a site in the desert ecosystem to showcase its work on a fusion reactor.  Since the federal government had mauled APPL funding, the only thing left for the Lab to do was virtual reality testing.  So they had developed, in the late 1990s, this tremendous VR program which they eventually hitched up to a portal in the vCity.  By linking to the site in the vCity, people could see exactly how a fusion reactor might work.
<P>I thought this was a very cool techsimm, but a lot of people had a lot of problems with it.  The desert environmentalists went apeshit, fearing the results of a catastrophic failure.  What most people do not understand, contrary to many exciting blow-em-up scenes in the movies, is that the results of catastrophic failure to maintain plasma in a magnetic containment field is pretty dull.  It goes <I>ploop</I>, and everything stops.  No, the problem the environmentalists had with the fusion reactor was that it required a fission reactor for start-up.  To produce more power than it consumes, a fusion power plant is literally one big sucker.
<P>A lot of engineers from around the world also criticized the model because, aside from the fact that the experts haven't even figured out how to sustain a core over the long-term, nobody knows exactly how to link that core to more traditional forms of steam or molten-salt driven turbine technology.  I thought that was pretty funny -- engineers arguing against a model of a future technology on the grounds that they hadn't invented parts of it yet.  Huh?  What did they think the vCity was for?  Advertising?
<P>Actually, the best argument against the establishment of a fusion power generator was the same one used against the establishment of fission power generators.  Just because something is technically possible and economically efficient, argued the critics, doesn't mean it is socially desirable or politically "efficient".  Laying aside public safety concerns about containment and long-term storage of spent fuel rods, nuclear fission plants are essentially undemocratic because they concentrate political and economic power instead of decentralizing it.  So even if they do bring desirable things to the table, such as plenty of kilowatts at low air pollution cost, they carry with them unwanted socio-political baggage.
<P>Where is that letter?  Ah, here it is, I still have this one in the archives.  Here is what one of our vCitizens wrote about the issue of power plants:

<P>
Big power plants of any kind are centralizing -- in terms<BR>
of capital, labor, and political authority -- when the whole idea<BR>
is to decentralize wherever possible.  Nevertheless, the simpler,<BR>
older technologies of steam-turbine generators fueled by oil,<BR>
gas, or coal are somewhat democratic in the sense that they are<BR>
understandable, reproducible on a medium-size scale, and deconstructable.<BR>
<P>
The advantages of using regular and exotic forms of hydrocarbon<BR>
and petrochemical fuels is obvious: more kilowatts per kilogram of fuel.<BR>
<P>
The disadvantages are legion.  It's hard to say which does greater<BR>
damage: despoiling the landscape and seascape, flora, and fauna<BR>
by drilling and mining; despoiling various parts of the planet by<BR>
spilling stuff all over the place; polluting the air, water, and land<BR>
by refining and distribution; by releasing toxic by-products into<BR>
the atmosphere; by creating architectural eyesores upon the land;<BR>
or by diverting human resources that could probably be put to better use elsewhere.<BR>
<P>
Tough call.<BR>
