<H4>Overview:</H4>
<P>
<B>CPC Corporation</B> is in the business of facilitating the borrowing and lending of money.  It is, in short, a bank.  However, it doesn't really operate as much as a bank as it does as a kind of exchange network among millions of vCitizens.  To this extent, it functions very similar to an electronic stock exchange in which people buy or sell stocks at specific buy/sell quotes.  In the case of CPCI's <I>Insta-Loan</I>[vTmk] eTransaction network, people buy and sell money at specific interest rate quotes.  The software, in fact, is remarkably similar in both systems.
<P>
The <I>Insta-Loan</I> [vTmk] network works on the principle that <I>everyone</I> can be a banker.  This is not necessarily a good thing, since a percentage of loaners have no idea what they are doing and a percentage of borrowers are deadbeats.  There are some elementary safeguards built into the system to prevent fraud, chiefly, a cap on transactions in both directions.  Loaners may only loan up to 10% of the value of their accounts and that means <I>cash</I> equivalents, not assets.  Borrowers are limited to unsecured borrowing up to 10% of <I>their</I> accounts or US$100,000, whichever is less.  <I>Secured</I> borrowing is of course possible at much higher totals.  This is especially useful for capital investment for plants and facilities for start-ups and small businesses.  It does, however, lead to occasionally spectacular failures and leaves the subscribers holding onto a "bag of wet leaves" (that is, even secured assets can be useless).
<P>
Depressing to many traditional bankers is the notion that the masses can compete with financial institutions, but in a sense this has always been true with the invention of government or government-sponsored loans.  The <I>Insta-Loan</I> [vTmk] network merely takes mass banking to its logical conclusion.
<P>
The main advantage of this decentralized money exchange is that it spreads risk across the entire subscriber base.  A default of US$100 million, for example, would ordinarily be a blow to many a lending institution.  In the case of the <I>Insta-Loan</I> [vTmk] network, however, that amounts to only about $2 per person.  This can easily be spread out over several years as well, amounting to something like a $0.25 charge per monthly invoice.  Hardly worth a bead of perspiration.
<P>
One thing that is very interesting about the <I>Insta-Loan</I> [vTmk] network is that subscribers can not only set bids for buy/sell interest rates, but also set <I>parameters</I> of buy/sell bids.  This allows subscribers to limit exactly how much they are willing to borrow or loan at what rates and also <I>who</I> might receive such bids, based on their profiles.  For example, subscribers of a specific religion may choose preferential buy/sell bids to members of that religion; other subscribers have set preferences for gender and age.  All of this is perfectly legal because profiles are <I>voluntarily</I> supplied by subscribers themselves -- therefore, anyone fearing discrimination on <I>any</I> basis whatsoever may avoid it simply by refusing to enter data into the network profile.  The preference system also allows borrowers and loaners to be choosy about who exactly they will take money from or give it to.  Vegetarians, for example, need not support cattle ranchers and vice versa.  No-growthers may refuse to lend to housing developers, and vice-versa.
<P>
This does tend to play havoc with traditional notions of "prevailing" interest rates, since there can be some pretty wild fluctuations among specific groups.  The most celebrated example was when a very wealthy widow decided to loan money at 0.1% APR to cat-owning females over 50 years of age.
<P>
In the final analysis, however, CPC's <I>Insta-Loan</I> [vTmk] network is a triumph of democratic anarchism at its most capitalist.  At very low cost, it reduces capital to an easily obtainable commodity, thereby ensuring overall liquidity and further driving down interest rates over time.  The flexibility permitted by software and telecomm infrastructure makes it possible for large numbers of people to directly influence, or retard, growth in specific industrial and commercial sectors -- a form of political economics achieved previously only through the laborious and time-consuming process of electing or unelecting political representatives to dictate economic policy over time, accompanied by the usual tiresome displays of graft, corruption, and just plain muddle-headedness.
<P>
<H4>Growth Potential?</H4>
Moderate.  If <B>CPCI</B> were the only game in town we would buck this rating up to "Good", however like any wildly successful phenomenon, the <I>Insta-Loan</I> [vTmk] quickly spawned rivals, and the idea of a eTransaction network is not patentable.  The software and security <I>is</I>, however, and we believe that <B>CPCI</B> does have the best wonks in the industry.  Ultimately profit margins rely on the ability for specialists to fine-tune or otherwise tweak the buy/sell and parameter-setting software.
<P>
The fundamental reason why the growth potential is not stronger is that <B>CPCI</B> makes its money on transaction growth, not the transactions themselves.  So profitability is ultimately related to population growth and the number of times individuals need to buy/sell money.
