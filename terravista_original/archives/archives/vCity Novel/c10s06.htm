<P>Backplot.  In the early 1990s, the budgets of the combined military services of the United States were shrinking.  In the U.S., where military expenditure is unique in the sense that it has <I>nothing</I> to do with actual military effectiveness and <I>everything</I> to do with business cycles, this caused a lot of dislocation to the economy -- more, in fact, than the advent of telecommuting.
<P>Quite a few corporations whose revenue streams were directly tied to government contracting started to panic.  They generally adopted one of four strategies.
<P>The first was denial, involving a massive amount of lobbying, advertising, directed campaign spending, and graft and corruption generally aimed at Congress.  For some it worked, but for most it did not, for the simple reason that people were unelecting their representatives faster than U.S. corporations and institutions could stockpile them in Washington, D.C.
<P>The second strategy was to merge with or acquire competitors.  For some that worked, but for most it did not.  Streamlining means removing redundant components.  In short, it meant firing people.  The chairborne regiment may enjoy jumping with golden parachutes, but generally speaking the great mass of people in a corporation do not like the idea of leaping out of a flaming airplane with no parachute.  There is no "soft landing" without a parachute.
<P>The third strategy was to tough it out alone and cut payroll.  Same problem.
<P>The fourth approach was to roll with the punch and look for new markets in which to leverage old products and services.
