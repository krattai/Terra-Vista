"...a confused clamor is heard on every side; and a thousand simultaneous voices demand the satisfaction of their social wants."
<P>
-- Alexis de Tocqueville --

<P>In the five years since we've had the vCity up and running, no referendum on any site has generated as much excitement as this one, according to current projections.  It's now been six days, and about 5% of the vCitizens -- a little less than three million people -- have cast their ballots.  As I anticipated, the initial sentiment in favor of "unrestricted expression" has worn thin, and more people, revolted by the <I>Exon Inspiration</I>, are now voting to remove the link on the grounds that the graphic acts of violence portrayed therein represent a future that is neither sustainable nor desirable.  Still, the vote is 85% against the <I>ban</I>.
<P>Judging from the nowlinks, the main problem seems to be <I>casbar</I>.  The Bahamian server is swamped with vCitizens demanding to know what the fuss is all about.  There are very few vCitizens who will cast a vote without seeing the issue directly and for themselves.  I like that in a community.  Don't take somebody else's word for it -- link now!
<P>Well, they better link soon, because judging from the phone calls I received today, the <I>casbar</I> that has been generated is going to seem like meditation compared to the flood of Internet hits soon to follow.  Because for the first time that I can remember, this is an issue that is generating interest outside the vCity community, and striking a resonant chord among the greater mass of real world citizens.
