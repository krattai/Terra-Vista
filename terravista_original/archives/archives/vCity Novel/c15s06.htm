<P>About an hour later, the phone rang again.  It was David Smythe-Johnson, Executive Vice-President for OGC.  Probably the Number Four man in the corporation.
<P>"What the <I>fuck</I> do you think you're doing?" he shouted over the phone.  The connection sounded bad, as if he were on a low-cost speaker phone.
<P>"Are you on speaker?" I asked quickly.
<P>"I'm on my car phone.  Hold on, I'm going to pull off the road."  He switched to his handheld.  "Is that better?"
<P>"Yes."
<P>"Okay, great.  Now, what the <I>fuck</I> do you think you're doing?" he shouted again.
<P>"In reference to what?"
<P>"I just got a phone call from Sandie.  She says she just got a phone call from one of the attorneys working for Literati Inc.  And she says that Canseco has already talked to you.  Is that true?"
<P>"Yes.  He just called me about an hour and a half ago."
<P>"Well you are <I>NOT</I> supposed to talk to anyone about anything, is that clear?"
<P>"Sure, Dave.  Next time Roberto Canseco calls me, I'll just hang up on him."
<P>"That is <I>NOT</I> what I mean and you damn well know it.  What did he say?"
<P>"He just wanted to warn me that if we pulled the link on the Exon Inspiration site, he would cut off my testicles and eat them for breakfast."
<P>"Jesus."
<P>"Actually, his exact phrase was <I>huevos</I>, so maybe I misunderstood him.  Maybe he meant that he wanted to eat an omelet for breakfast."
<P>"Don't fuck with me, Forest.  Did he threaten you?  Really?"
<P>"No, not really.  He seemed quite concerned that we would be getting a 59B in the mail, though."
<P>"A 59B?" wailed Smythe-Johnson.  "Are you shitting me?"
<P>"No.  John Warden hinted that he might send one to you."
<P>"<I>You talked with Warden too?!</I>"
<P>"About two hours ago."
<P>"Fuck!  You are <I>NOT</I> supposed to be talking with him."
<P>"Okay, I'll hang up on him, too."
<P>"Jesus," wailed Smythe-Johnson again.  "What did <I>he</I> say?"
<P>"It was just a courtesy call.  To let us know that the TSD is watching the situation."
<P>I heard a moan on the other end of the phone.
<P>"Dave, you okay?"
<P>"Yeah, I'm here."
<P>"I really think you should take a stress pill, Dave."
<P>"Listen to me very carefully.  If anyone -- ANYONE -- calls you about corporate business, you refer them to me.  You understand that?  Because you are lower than <I>whaleshit</I>.  You hear me?"
<P>"I hear you.  Run silent, run deep."
<P>"Huh?"
<P>"No talking to anyone.  What about my wife?"
<P>"Don't fuck with me, Forest.  I'll . . ."  Suddenly the connection faded and disappeared.
<P>Thankfully, I hung up the cradle.  "Well, it wasn't a very interesting conversation," I explained to Londo.  "How far down <I>does</I> whaleshit sink, anyway?"
