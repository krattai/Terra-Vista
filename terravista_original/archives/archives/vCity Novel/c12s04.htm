<P>With step-by-step menu-driven spoon-feeding formatting technique -- what is known in the trade politely as the "Bite Size Shredded Wheat (Trademark Nabisco Corp.)" philosophy of web page design -- we teach them the fundamentals of life in the vCity: what various terms mean, how the simulation works, what kinds of things they might like to see.  We even provide them with a little quiz to make sure that they understand what they are about to look at.  That way, if someone does not understand something, we can go over it detail and explain it to them.  All of this in fourteen different languages.
<P>Since people like to feel that they are "entering" a world, just like real world tourists, we give them a choice of how they would like to enter the vCity.  They can begin their tour at the vCity International Airport, or at the vCity Seaport.  Most people are familiar with aircraft these days, so most tourists like to enter through the airport.
<P>Before they debark on their internetworking adventure, however, we also warn people to be careful.  It's the VR version of "don't drink the water", I suppose.  The number one lesson is <I>caveat emptor</I>.  If they transmit credit numbers over the Internet, that's their problem, not ours.  Information is encrypted only as long as they stay within the boundaries of the vCity simulation; however, the whole thing works on the principle of decentralization, so most of the City Coordinates link to sites outside of our corporate server.
