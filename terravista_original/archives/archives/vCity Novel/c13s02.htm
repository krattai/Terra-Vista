<P>The first technical system that we "imposed" was the one that we knew best, namely, the telecomm/comp/edu/info/finance/advert/entertainment industry.  Affectionately known among aficionados as The Blob.  More generally referred to as the "convergence" of hardware, software, and internetworking.  Oh, and the creation and ownership of digital content and digital money.
<P>The telecomm system of the vCity was created to demonstrate some basic principles in which our corporation believed.  At times I thought it was dangerously close to self-serving narcissism, but in the end I agreed that it was not a bad place to start.  The first rule was true and fair competition in every telecomm marketplace.  You name it: hardware, software, and customer support and service for every aspect of production, refining, distribution, storage, consumption, or reproduction of electronic or photonic data, information, knowledge and amusement.
<P>Our first rule of thumb -- somewhat ironic, in light of subsequent events -- was that anything should be allowed to go anywhere at anytime.  All data content would be unrestricted, uncensored, and unexamined.  <I>Caveat Emptor</I>.
<P>However, our second rule of thumb was that the citizens should retain legal title to every scrap of frequency spectrum, every micron of wire and/or fiber on public domain, and every <I>archebyte</I> (data stored or generated in the vCity Data Freewarehouse).
<P>This was obviously a peculiar mixture of techno-economic theories out of which we struggled to make some sense.  In the world of the vCity, and therefore of the real future, there would be no restriction on any form of private networking.  Ziggurat-towers in Plasteel Canyon, for example, could install their own fiber-optic rings for the ultimate in ftp/telnet/audio/video/holographic pleasure.  They could have their own form of electronic currency, their own proprietary laws about software and copyright, and their own security devices.  But the nanosecond anyone would want to use the public domain -- the airwaves or the millions of kilometers of datalines laid out alongside public tracks, roads, cables, and pipes -- then they would be bound by the Rule Of The People.
<P>Our executives read all of this and asked the Zoning Council, "So, what does all that mumbo-jumbo mean?"
