<P>We never really had to bother with designing a water-based transportation system for the simple reason that there really wasn't any place to <I>go</I>.  The fundamental tenet of transportation is that it is a process of moving people and cargo from A to B.  However, the vCity wasn't set up to simulate an archipelago.  In short, anyone who wants to can move from A to A, which isn't very exciting.  The "B", so to speak, is a motley collection of off-shore industrial destinations (sites) including an oil-drilling platform techsimm, two undersea research and/or mining facilities simmcorps, and a handful of aquaculture farm sites.
<P>Nevertheless, we tried to set up some kind of seaport infrastructure that would enable individuals and corporations to engage in residential, commercial/leisure, and industrial activity on the Bay and the Ocean, even if all they did was float around.  Surprisingly, there was a brisk demand for VR design of new fishing vessels, oceanographic research vessels, cruise ships, casino ships, restaurant ships, whale watchers, pleasure motor- and sailboats of all kinds, and houseboats.  Apparently boat and ship designers had already been using VR technology in their Computer Assisted Design and Manufacture (CAD/CAM), so it was relatively easy for professionals to fool around with VR sites on the side.
<P>Someone even did a marketing study of the potential for servicing an off-shore residential population.  After all, reasoned the analysts, if people are going to drift like motorized jellyfish in their brand-new houseboats, they will need supplies and services.  It gave a whole new meaning to the phrase "cash float."  Anyway, what they discovered is that construction and operation of houseboats is still very expensive, and there are drawbacks to sacrificing a fixed position even in an age of wireless comm technology.
