<P>The second phone call was worse, not because it was muddle-headed but because it was directly to the point.
<P>"Forest?  John Warden here."
<P>"Hello, Warden.  How are things over in Thought Control?"
<P>"You're a funny man, Forest, that's why we're going to put you in jail last."
<P>"Well, I appreciate that, Warden.  Congress still gutting your budget?"
<P>"Oh no," he laughed.  "We're not the FCC anymore -- don't you remember?  Our department reports to the NSA now."
<P>"Ah yes, the National Insecurity Agency.  So, what can I do for you today?"
<P>"Well, it's this pornography thing."
<P>My stomach sank.  "What about it?"
<P>"I'm just surprised it's still available to the public."
<P>"Why is that, Warden?  Is the Internet broken?"
<P>"Not yet.  What I mean is, why is your corporation abetting the dissemination of pornography?"
<P>"That would be a serious violation of existing U.S. statutes if it were true."
<P>"Yes, my thoughts exactly."
<P>We paused for a few seconds.
<P>"So," I finally ventured, "are you saying that you're going to issue a 59B?"  This is shorthand reference to a stack of legislation that empowers the NSA to fine an individual or corporation for a number of telecomm violations.
<P>He sighed.  "No.  Not at this time.  Not sure the courts would go for it."
<P>"The First Amendment <I>is</I> such a nuisance, isn't it?"
<P>"Not at all, my boy.  We love the U.S. constitution, actually.  It empowers the federal government to do anything that is necessary and proper.  Of course, this isn't a first amendment issue as you know.  Pornography isn't speech, and obscenity isn't a right guaranteed by the constitution."
<P>"Yes."
<P>"Okay, Forest.  Just wanted to let you know we're aware of the situation."
<P>"Our tax dollars hard at work."
<P>"Yes.  'Bye for now."  He hung up.
<P>I looked at Londo sitting by the keyboard.
<P>In my best southern drawl I said, "Now what we have <I>here</I>, is a <I>failure</I> to tele-communicate."  Londo sighed.  He's heard this moldy <B>Cool Hand Luke</B> joke many times, and he is bored with it.  But it really did fit the situation.  I mean, how many times in one's life does one get to tango with a bureaucrat named Warden?
