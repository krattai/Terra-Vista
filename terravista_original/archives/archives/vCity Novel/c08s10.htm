<P>I remember when I showed VR tech stuff to my father for the first time.  He was mortified, and refused to don an HMD helmet.
<P>"I won't," he said.  "I think these things are wrong."
<P>"What do you mean, Dad?"
<P>"People will be living in their fantasy worlds, and they'll all get eye strain and fat asses.  Go for a walk instead!"
<P>"Very interesting philosophy.  I believe it's called PullPlugism."
<P>"Don't be so smart.  You read Huxley with his <I>feelies</I> didn't you?"
<P>"<B>Brave New World</B>.  So?"
<P>"Same thing."
<P>"Well, I disagree.  You can overdo and misuse any technology.  Haven't we heard the same complaints about television for the last fifty years?  That people don't get out any more, that they just sit home and watch cable television?  Or movies on their VCRs?  Radio, CDs, it's all the same.  Electronic entertainment."
<P>"People should read more," he muttered.
<P>"Perhaps so, but riddle me this, Batman: what is a fiction novel, but a very low-tech form of virtual reality entertainment?"
<P>"Oh, don't be so smart."
<P>"Look, Dad.  Think of it this way.  Everyone wants to be able to afford luxuries.  But by definition, that's an impossibility.  No truly democratic society can stand the strain of being truly capitalist, because capitalism efficiently reveals the fact that some of us are brighter or more stupid than others.  So we have to devise politics of substitution whereby the great mass of people can enjoy the form of luxury without its substance.  People need to believe that they can do whatever they want, enjoy whatever they please -- even though the environmental damage from pursuing such a course of action would destroy the planet."
<P>He stubbornly shook his head.  "Not the planet.  Just the people."
<P>"C'mon," I said, shutting off the power on the helmet.  "Let's you and me go for a walk."
<P>He brightened.  "That would be good."
