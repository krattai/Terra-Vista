<P>Others wanted to burn trash.  Organic waste matter is actually a good source of fuel.  While most of it should be returned to the soil, a significant by-product of decomposition is methane gas.  Methane can be burned to heat water into steam, turning turbines, etcetera, etcetera.  Or, in a less soil-friendly way, one can just burn biomass directly as a source of fuel for steam-turbines.
<P>The major issue here was not whether incinerators were technical feasible or economical, but were they socially desirable and sustainable?  A methane extraction, or plain biomass-burning, power plant is a big capital investment.  It's noisy, it's ugly, and it can be smelly.  Great care has to be taken to separate out things that can be burned from things that shouldn't be, for environmental and economic reasons.  Even if small, affordable "neighborhood" burners are built and installed and operated, the fact remains that burning biomass removes it from the ecosystem and converts it into atmosphere, where it may be some time before it reconverts back into organisms again.
<P>That vote was a very close one, helped, I think, by the fact that in the vCity, there aren't any bad odors.  MSE equipment hasn't progressed to the point that people can start releasing odors upon each other.  Personally, I don't mind if that's an innovation that <I>never</I> occurs.
