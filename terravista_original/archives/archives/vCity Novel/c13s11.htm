<P>Still other vCitizens proudly designed their office buildings and domiciles using solar energy: specifically, photovoltaic (PV) and solar dynamic (SD) systems.  A lot of people still don't know what these are, even in the year 2002, so I'll backfill for a moment here.
<P>Photovoltaic cells by definition convert photons into direct electric current.  Put a bunch of 'em (called an "array") together, and <I>presto</I>, instant juice.  Rotate these arrays to track the sun (if sunflowers can do it, so can we), and more juice.  Voltage problem?  Convert it into alternating current.
<P>Solar dynamic reflectors are also hot items (yes, pun intended) using a process beloved in politics: smoke and mirrors.  To be more precise, an SD dish is a parabolic mirror that concentrates the sun's rays at a single focal point.  Pump a liquid through this spot, and you get very hot liquid or gas that wants to go places.  It can be used to do all sorts of interesting things, such as turn a turbine.  Spinning magnets is not only a wacky way to pass the time, but it also produces electrical current.  Siphon off part of that juice to pump the (now cooled) liquid back into the loop, and you've got yourself a nice perpetual energy generator, gift of the sun (a/k/a Mr. Fusion).
<P>I pointed out to the sun-worshippers that they were ignoring some problems that would not be apparent in a VR setting, but which certainly would be a problem in real reality.  For one thing, things like clouds and neighboring buildings can cut down on solar efficiency.  Secondly, Gallium Arsenide cells or their technological brethren aren't peanut butter sandwiches.  There's a toxicity in PV cell production that's dangerous, not to mention the cost of production and replacement.  The newer processes to etch directly on to thin plastic films might have solved that problem, but I doubt it.  As for the SD systems, I thought they looked like Rube Goldbergian devices that would require a high level of sophisticated maintenance and repair (an ammonia leak in one's two-phase thermal loop isn't exactly the equivalent of the pot boiling over on the stove).  Also, an SD system requires consistent sunlight to be effective and efficient.  Excellent for places such as Antarctica from October through March, but what about the rest of the Earth?
<P>I was tempted to add that there were a number of ways to use <I>passive</I> solar heating to convert sunlight directly into heat without bothering with electricity.  But I didn't want to seem like a spoilsport, so I let the matter slide.
