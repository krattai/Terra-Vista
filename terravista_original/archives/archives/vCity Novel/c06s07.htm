<P>The vCitizens had a tremendous argument over horse racing.  There was nothing wrong with the horse track simulation built for the S&E by the Very Off-Track Betting Corporation (a simmcorp, real world Registry Protected).  VOTB violated no zoning ordinances.  There was not even anything wrong with telegambling, as far as our lawyers could tell, since it did not involve an exchange of real world money on servers located within the United States.  The main objection came from animal rights activists, who objected to a horse racing simulation on the basis that the exploitation of animals for profit was neither a desirable nor sustainable future.
<P>This was a toughy which the vPopuli had to hack out.  Were not humans animals too?  And if humans could not be exploited for profit, then the whole premise of capitalist democracy was fundamentally unsound.  In the words of one of my erstwhile colleagues on the vCity Zoning Council, "Oy Gevalt."
<P>In the end, we did hold a referendum, and the site was <I>banned</I>.  On the Occams' Razor scale, this one was a close shave.  The issue distilled down to this: humans have free will and reason, therefore within certain boundaries, they may exploit each other (slavery being on the shit list, however); because non-human animals do not have both free will and reason, human exploitation of non-human animals for profit should be forbidden, and therefore no animal racing, zoos, or circuses.  The counter argument ran: how do you know that non-human animals do not have free will and reason?
<P>There was also a side tangent that caused more controversy.  Those who advocated animal rights were largely concerned with mammal rights, for obviously parochial reasons.  They naturally raised the question of the viability and sustainability of such things as cattle ranching, rabbit farms, and mammal-based medical research for pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.  But non-human animals covered a far greater territory including fish, birds, insects, arachnids, mollusks, amphibians, and eukaryotes.
<P>In one case, there was a zoning volume in the beachfront and sanddune suburb of Unpretentious run by a guy who was showcasing the way to sell electricity generated from electric eels.  There was nothing wrong with the VR design -- he was well within CC limits -- and I thought that the organic sustainability of the idea was rather clever.  A referendum was called, nevertheless, on the basis that while generating electricity from eels might be an appropriate technology for us, it wasn't appropriate for the <I>eels</I>.  If I remember correctly, the site was not banned after the owner promised to prove that the eels were happy, well-fed, and feeling no pain.  How he intended to prove this was something of a mystery.
<P>Anyway, we reached the nadir (or zenith, depending upon one's viewpoint) of the controversy when some people started advocating the rights of all life forms including plants.  There was some question about florists and agribusiness, and whether they had the right to exploit and murder flowers and plants for their own capitalist interests.  As the same colleague later said, "Oy Gevalt Squared."  It was, indeed, very talmudic.
<P>All of this reminded me of the joke of the furrier who sold mink coats on the basis that all of the minks involved committed suicide.  Of course, to many people on the net, the sanctity of life is no joke.  We haven't come to resolution on just how sanctified we wish to become in the future.  I guess when we started the vCity we knew that social-political discussions like this were going to happen.  Maybe that, also, was the point.
