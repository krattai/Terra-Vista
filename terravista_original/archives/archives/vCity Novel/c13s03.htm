<P>So I wrote a short essay trying to clarify the point:<BR>
<P><B>
Imagine that telecomm is like railroading where the technology is infinitely flexible.  Your track can be any gauge, your engines any size and power, your trains of any length, your cars of any type, and your cargo is loaded & packed by you and you determine its contents.  You can build whatever railroad empire you want -- or, more likely, you can hire one of the telecomm corporations to do it -- as long as it rests on your own property.  But that's a small domain.  If you want to transport some cargo to your friend on the other side of the city, you have to use a private carrier on tracks laid down by the carrier, but which the city "owns" and leases back to the carrier.  The carrier charges you a small fee for loading & unloading your cargo at the desired destination, because the carrier has to cover costs.  And the carrier has to obey the law of the land on such things as track gauge, train size, and safety regulations.
<P>
In the real world, as portrayed by the vCity simulation, local government would assign the use of specific frequencies throughout the spectrum, and the use of internetworking hardware and software, to the highest bidder on a lease or rental basis only.  Lease and rental fees would be examined and redefined on a periodic basis.  The mode of contract would depend on whether a given locality was satisfied with its services, or desired to upgrade or expand.  Our experience has shown that lease arrangements often work better for stimulating the development of new and better services, because private corporations can turn around and take massive tax write-offs for depreciation of equipment they temporarily own.
<P>
Why would any company build a telecomm network under these conditions?  Very simple -- profit.  Since short-term outflow is fixed but income can be variably accrued (charged) on a per-use basis, a carrier will do everything possible to encourage use.  Chiefly, that means by supplying the best possible service for the lowest possible price per use; "service" defined not just in terms of carrying bitstreams back and forth, but in creating whole new ways for people to generate more bitstreams.
<P>
Gaining access to users in this world will be critical, so carriers will probably tend to engage in bidding wars for choice telecomm "estate".  Denying use of or access to lines for whatever reason, such as trying to give a nuggie to a business competitor, will become economic suicide long before it becomes political suicide.
