<P>A year or so ago, I received a letter from an old friend of mine, formerly a professor at Benjamin Thompson University, now a Dean.  His new title is Director for Special Policy or something like that.  BTU was one of the first "real" universities to realize the terrible dilemma that any business faces when it is saddled with an aging infrastructure and eroding market share.  They had been working on some document called "University 21" or "Reinventing the University", I can't remember which, and kept re-issuing the damn thing for about five years.  They were very good at saying where they wanted to go, but somehow, they were having trouble getting there.  So he wrote me a letter asking for my advice and response to the annual draft of the policy document.
<P>Here is what I wrote in e-reply:

Dear Pete:<BR>
<P>
Look, the first and most important rule of university administration<BR>
for the future is: if it is possible to provide an educational service<BR>
by telecommunication, then *don't* build an infrastructure to provide<BR>
that same service.  After all, buildings, facilities and equipment<BR>
cost a ton of money to construct, maintain, and refurbish.<BR>
<P>
Secondly, in cases where infrastructure must be created,<BR>
adjust your fees to assure that primary users are primary providers.<BR>
Subsidize only at the behest of wealthy patrons or the government;<BR>
facilities that prove to be unprofitable should be sold off to a competitor.<BR>
<P>
What kinds of facilities remain?  Largely, any activity that is physical.<BR>
For example, to teach someone how to play tennis,<BR>
one needs a tennis instructional facility where both teacher<BR>
and student can work up a sweat.<BR>
There's only so much one can do with bioengineered telepresence, after all.<BR>
HMD/MSE technology can only go so far, at least for now.<BR>
<P>
Here, the university must assess whether this is an infrastructure<BR>
that it wants to build, knowing that it will be competing with private courts and lanes.<BR>
<P>
The university must adjust its expectations to the specifics of the marketplace.<BR>
If it does build and operate a facility, the life-cycle costs must be passed on to the users.<BR>
But obviously, fees cannot be significantly higher than those charged<BR>
by other corporations unless the university adds value in some way.<BR>
<P>
So adding value is the key.  The real world university of the future will probably<BR>
become very much a social club offering state-of-the-art<BR>
sports and entertainment practice facilities and clinics.<BR>
It will also become a fun place to go to engage in all kinds of social events<BR>
that are not necessarily mainstream.<BR>
(if they were, they would likely be offered by someone else more cheaply).<BR>
<P>
In fact, the only thing that will provide the university of the future<BR>
with the high margin revenue it needs to survive and expand<BR>
is that its employees will be creative and willing to take risks<BR>
in stretching the boundaries of art, music, theater, performance & exhibitions,<BR>
etcetera.  New services and ideas, by definition, have no<BR>
established pricing structure -- so when something becomes<BR>
sufficiently mainstream and competition arises,<BR>
that will be your signal to sell off a facility to private interests and try something new.<BR>
<P>
The real world university will also provide some facilities<BR>
that abet research and development in medicine, science and technology.<BR>
After all, despite some incredible gains in modeling software,<BR>
there are still some things that need to be tested physically,<BR>
if for no other reason than to assure engineers that their<BR>
modeling assumptions about such things as airflow or<BR>
tensile cohesion are really true.<BR>
Some systems, such as biological organisms, are so complicated<BR>
that modeling them is well-nigh impossible, and again,<BR>
a physical laboratory is often necessary to test new methods and products.<BR>
