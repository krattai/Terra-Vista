<P>Another source of moving water that is only beginning to be seriously studied for its potential for generating electricity is the tidewater and ocean.  I am absolutely agog with the different theories and proposals for tapping the power of waves and tides.  The simplest, small-scale ones do seem to be the best: undershoot water wheels generating small amounts of alternating direct current.  Kinda cute.  Disadvantages?  Time and tide is the ultimate universal <I>dissolvent</I>.  There's not a construction technology invented yet that is impervious to the combined forces of erosion, salt corrosion, sandblasting, and wind damage that the average ocean applies in a given decade or two.
<P>Deep water also offers electricity generating potential.  The OffShore Alternate Energy Corporation (a simmcorp for a Registry Protected company) set up a very interesting techsimm.  In their VR site, they converted an old oil-drilling platform into a testbed for generating current from temperature differentials.  They drive turbines by recycling ammonia through a vaporization/condensation loop.  Kinda neat.
<P>We had an argument about that one, too.  Oceanologists complained about the unknown environmental effects of heating the bottom of the ocean very slightly.  It's okay for a testbed, they argued, but what if <I>everyone</I> starts doing it?  Other people said the platform looked ugly.
<P>My major concern, which I put forth to the OAEC, was: you can generate electricity out in the middle of the deep blue, what do you propose to <I>do</I> with it?  The OAEC guy e-wrote me back suggesting that OAEC hoped to electrolyze seawater into liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen for the fuel cell industry.  I told him that between the environmental impact statements and the safety problems of shipping & handling, he would be in danger of drowning in an ocean of paperwork.
<P>Keep fishing, guys.  Maybe one day you'll be able to sell kilowatts to passing boats or something.
