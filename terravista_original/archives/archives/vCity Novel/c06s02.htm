<P>So, with that in mind, I find the Plasteel Canyon RAThole in order to go to the Sports & Entertainment Complex to see what all the Lightspeed fuss is about.  I could just <I>beam</I> over to the S&E, of course.  But what fun would that be?
<P>Ever since I was a kid, I have had a secret love affair with model trains, and the one we ultimately designed for the vCity beats them all.  The vCity sports a state-of-the-art interconnected light rail and rapid area transit system.  It's a shame so few people bother to use it instead of impatiently bookmarking.  Maybe that's because we never moved it out of PC-based scrolling mode, and the new rage is HMD and MSE.
<P>Truthfully the mass transit system is one of the few quasi-socialist techsimms our corporation installed.  We had a lot of arguments about this technology, and in the end, neither we nor the transit consultants could figure out how to guarantee universal access via the free marketplace and yet retain system safety and efficiency.
<P>We decided that the techsimm transit system would probably be managed by public corporations with long-term contracts with local government, which basically would charge low fixed fees in exchange for the right to keep a ceiling on fares and, therefore, profits.  Passengers would purchase ticket/tokens at automated kiosks at the stations; the price of the ticket/token depending on the distance between departure and destination points.  Free passes would be issued to all tourists and anyone who claimed to be unable to afford to purchase fare.  To encourage people not to freeload on the system (there is no enforcement), ticket/tokens would serve as lottery tickets, and winners would receive all sorts of free trips and prizes.  Those who could not afford to purchase ticket/tokens would donate labor towards system maintenance to enter the transit lottery.
<P>The light rail system was scheduled to operate 05:00 to 24:00 VCT for the convenience of commuters to and from the regional suburbs.  It would seamlessly connect to the Rapid Area Transit (R.A.T.) system which would operate continuously for the convenience of the denizens of the vCity downtown proper and the more densely populated suburbs.  The R.A.T. featured both above- and below-ground stations.  The two systems, although connected at eight transfer <B>(T)</B> points by inclement-weatherproof walkway/tunnels and reporting to the same city-wide transportation coordination center, would operate functionally independent of each other.  This was because we conceived that the R.A.T. would be highly automated and technology-intensive; the rules and training that applied to its construction, safe operation, maintenance and repair would be more complex and would probably not be appropriate for the simpler light rail system.  For example, R.A.T. maintenance personnel and robots would have to work in packet shifts; whereas light rail crews could work uninterrupted between the hours of  00:01 and 04:59 VCT.
<P>We figured there would be a friendly rivalry between the personnel of the two systems.  R.A.T. people would be highly paid, well-trained professionals, mostly managers and software engineers, drawn from the ranks of the light rail corps or "junior varsity."  Light rail people would tend to be younger, more laid back, and look upon the R.A.T. either with bemusement or as a possible "career-advancement thing."
<P>The light rail system was designed to alleviate traffic congestion from low and mid-density areas to each other; there would be a basic "beltway" shape, plus a few spokes.  Intracity commuters therefore would not have to go through the downtown of the vCity to get where they wanted to go.  The typical train for off-peak hours is a two-car affair, but some trains would offer 3-6 cars depending upon schedule and city-wide transportation system traffic flow reports.
<P>The cars are manufactured by the EEB Corporation (a simmcorp) which owns both its manufacturing plants and headquarters in the vCity.  EEB <I>Kleinwagen</I> cars seat 64 and have a total capacity of 80.  They are designed for the convenience of commuters, and boast a number of features including complete access and special equipment for the physically challenged, wide and comfortable seats with adjustable cushioning, shift-polarity windows (the kind that can be lightened or darkened electrochemically at a push of a button), personal audio/video displays with ISDN input/output jacks, spacious luggage racks, bicycle racks, washroom/shower/change facilities, and food and beverage dispensing machines.  The cars are powered by electric third rail and are equipped with twin drive engines capable of a maximum speed of approximately 90 kph.  In the event of total network power outage, emergency LiH batteries supply enough power to move a car to the next rail station.  Each car is autodirectional and has two cabs which seat a maximum crew of two.
<P>Light rail stations, we decided, would have a pleasing, ranch-style look and architecture.  They would be designed for the convenience of the commuter and feature ample parking and luxurious climate-controlled waiting areas.  Some of the fancier ones would also have concession stands, vKiosks, cafes, that kind of thing.
