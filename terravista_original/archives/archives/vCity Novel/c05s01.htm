"In democratic communities, each citizen is habitually engaged in the contemplation of a very puny object, namely, himself."

<P>The sector of downtown vCity called Plasteel Canyon mostly resembles the opening scene from the movie <B>Blade Runner</B>, only without the pollution, the natural gas burnoffs, or the incessant rain.  I was impatient to see a new millennium metropolis with buildings so high and massive that they needed their own weather forecasts.  These twenty-first century pyramids, I envisioned, would be called "ziggurats".
<P>One of the earliest and still one of the best ziggurat sites in all of Plasteel Canyon is the <I>Minas Ithil</I> zoning volume.  At its base at ground level, it occupies an entire city block.  From the ground level looking up (this is more effective with an HMD than in PC-based mode) one cannot see to the top.  I am told that the "sink" (that part of the ZV that stretches in the opposite direction, "below" the horizon) is equally large.  Tunnels connect <I>Minas Ithil</I> to the vast labyrinth of Belowtown.  It is written that the <I>Minas Ithil</I> site is home to more than 100,000 vCitizens.  And there are close to one hundred more just like it in the Plasteel Canyon area.
<P>The jeweled, cathedral-like doorway to this obsidian black-and-red tower is a famous point of reference for tourists.  First time city visitors debarking at the vCity International Airport who are too impatient to take mass transit to the downtown sectors like to <I>beam</I> here directly, so that they too, can gawk and later claim a unique mass marketing experience.
<P>Being a tourist attraction has its problems, though.  The <I>Minas Ithil</I> planning coordination council had to purchase a duplicate server just to handle the overflow of visitors, and several times the site crashed anyway.  As a result visitors started coming in through sidelinks and swamped several unsuspecting citizens within the ziggurat, crashing their servers.  No one had predicted this kind of traffic problem, which today we call "casbar".  (I checked into that recently.  Apparently, the word is a combination of the term <I>cas</I>cade failure and fu<I>bar</I>, which itself stands for Fucked Up Beyond All Recognition)
<P>Desperate, the <I>Minas Ithil</I> board appealed to our corporation to help them out.  We solved the problem by the simple expedient of redesigning the ZV to include a "buffer" of vKiosks.  In other words, we distracted tourists from entering the ziggurat directly by forcing them past vKiosks where they could read the latest nowlinks.  It worked.  <I>Minas Ithil</I> reports that while traffic has only decreased 3%, server outage has decreased by more than 90%, and customer satisfaction has boomed by almost 20%.
<P>It was obvious to me that such incredible pieces of vertical construction as the ziggurats -- small cities in themselves -- would require new construction materials.  At NASA they used to have a word for this: "Unobtainium".  Regrettably, at the time we needed to name the vCity sectors, my imagination cup runneth empty.  The only thing I came up with was "plasteel", a wheezing geezer of an SF cliché if there ever was one.  I didn't know about aromatic lithocarbons at the time we needed to zone the vCity.
<P>Oh well.  There are hundreds of examples of things like that in the vCity, if one knows about them.  We tried to bury such minor conceptual errors under the sediment of semi-plausible explanations, but the fact is, if I could anticipate the future of technology with any accuracy at all, I'd be heavily invested in stock markets, wouldn't I?
