<P>One of the things that we <I>did</I> predict accurately was the concept of the nowlink as a logical successor to the newspaper.  That one was a no-brainer.  It required no imagination at all, merely observation of what was already transpiring in the mid 1990s.
<P>Historically speaking, the newspaper was an artifact of the 16th through 20th centuries.  For its day it was a great innovation, but that was when: a) not much new happened on a daily basis; b) cheap rag-based paper was a hot new transmission medium, supplanting parchment; and c) printing became a reliable word-processing technology.  It was no mistake of history that the nation famous for its printing presses and publishing houses -- the United Provinces of Holland et al -- was also viciously capitalist and predominantly seafaring.  News in those days was primarily an International Business Section, with maybe a little gossip on the side and a few editorials to fill out the blank spots.  Sea captains originally provided this early value-added information service, but the demand for business dispatches from overseas grew greater than the ability for one man to supply over dinner and cordials.  In effect, the newspaper functioned as a public dispatch service.
<P>By the late 20th century, however, a) <I>everything</I> was changing simultaneously; b) we had internetworking, a hot new transmission medium; c) we had hardware and software which, combined together, created an even more reliable word-processing technology.  Every person who could afford Internet access, a modem, a computer, software, and a printer -- and in many nations, that amounted to less than 10% of an average yearly per capita income -- could become a "newspaper" publisher.
<P>In short, worldwide infodemocracy was born.   As with most newborns, the first thing it did was mewl, cry, puke, and generally keep everyone sleepless at night.
<P>How would the "newspaper" translate to the realm of the vCity?  We realized that the major problem with the "newspaper" (or any variation therein including newsletters, news magazines, digests, etc.) was that it was fundamentally static -- the same problem with CD-ROMs or video cassettes or diskettes.  Once issued, the object becomes an artifact.  The ideal "newspaper" would be instantly updatable and retransmittable -- in effect, it would provide the reader with continuous editions.  Somewhat on the order of radio and television news, but infinitely flexible and tailored to the specific reader.  Not broadcasting, but planting selected seeds for different soils.
<P>We also realized that the "newspaper" (and its hardcopy cousins) was essentially a higher-order reference manual for society at large.  In other words, if one wanted to judge a movie, one might read a movie review.  If one wanted to see the movie, one might look in the paper to see where and when the movie was playing.  But the paper did not <I>itself</I> provide the movie, or previews of the movie.  It just referred to them.  Same thing with restaurants, or sporting events, or museums.
<P>In the vCity however, there was no reason why, if one were reading about something and wanted to see it, one could not simply go <I>see</I> it.  If someone was describing what they liked (or disliked) about a particular zoning volume or vSite -- for example, vGolf Course #6 -- they would provide the city coordinate for vGC6, and one could <I>beam</I> there in a few seconds.  In other words, a "newspaper" for the vCity could be not only a higher-order reference manual, but a transportation medium.  Which is why we decided on the term "nowlink".
<P>Since the vCity was created as a marketing tool for the purpose of simulation, however, we realized that we needed many places where people could easily find nowlinks.  In a burst of intellectual creativity previously displayed only by U.S.S.R. state planning committees, the Zoning Council came up with the name vKiosk.  Well, I suppose I am being harsh.  It could have been worse.  The kiosk is a piece of architecture whose form goes back to the 17th century, derived from the Turkish <I>kushk</I> or open-air pavilion.  It functioned, then as now, as a small tent from which to offer goods and services.
<P>Several people in our corporation wanted to design a standardized vKiosk and place thousands of them throughout the vCity, but I argued against that on the grounds that if the people wanted landscape ennui, they could stay in the real world.  The advantage of a vKiosk was that it could supply an infinite number of nowlinks from a relatively small VR volume.  Its shape could be pleasingly bizarre as long as it fit within the confines of the laws of physics.
<P>In the end, I won that one.  Admittedly vKiosks sprouted like mushrooms and gave the early vCity the look and feel of a bizarre bazaar.  So what?  To modify the metaphor, when one lets a thousand flowers blossom, one is bound to get a pretty wild garden.
<P>Actually the vKiosks don't just provide nowlinks, which was another example of the first rule of vCity development: Expect the Unexpected.  When people started building vKiosks, they offered nowlinks, but they also started to sell goods and services.
<P>A typical example of a good was what today we call <I>downloads</I>, or in other words, pieces of software.  A download could be any digitized content from simple text to scapps.  Some early entrepreneurs made tidy sums selling freely available VR tools to unsuspecting tourists, but we cracked down on that early by the simple expedient of instructing first-time visitors to the vCity that we could make most VR tools available to them for free if and when they wanted to become vCitizens.
<P>Some bastards also sold software viruses, but we cracked down on that, too.  The solution to that particular form of telecrime was simple.  I just told the Mole rats about it.  The Mole rats are vigilante packs of vCitizens who took up residence in the Belowtown sector of Mole.  Their demographics indicate that they are worldwide, mostly male, between the ages of 8-16.  They spend most of their time telegoofing around, as kids and teenagers like to do.  If you ask them nicely to help, though, then they swarm viciously and continuously against a telecriminal until justice is rendered.  It isn't a pretty sight, but then again, it works.  The vCity is virtually free of crime, and yet there are no police.
<P>An example of a service was what are now called <I>mapps</I> (Marketing Applications).  At first, these were literally maps of the vCity, which early vCitizens updated themselves.  Within the first year of operations, however, the vCity went "from sponge to onion" and grew so fast that it proved impossible to map everything.  Whereupon several clever vCitizens began to sell <I>mapps</I> that asked tourists and new vCitizens what kinds of things they wanted to see.  In effect, an "intelligent" and instantly updated map that could show different aspects of the vCity depending upon the customer's desire.  Our corporation found that so interesting that we ended up marketing the idea profitably in the real world as our GridUnlock (Trademark) software package.  Real real estate agents worldwide were crashing our servers trying to download new editions at $0.79 a copy, plus applicable sales tax.
