"In democracies there is always a multitude of persons whose wants are above their means, and who are very willing to take up with imperfect satisfaction, rather than abandon the object of their desires altogether."

<P>The first nightfall of summer, shortest night of the year.  It's a hot, muggy evening in Washington, D.C., the kind that smothers conversation underneath a wet blanket of lassitude.  Anyone who has lived in this city knows the apocryphal tale that for many years the British Ambassador to the United States received tropical pay and was allowed to wear khaki dress as partial compensation for being forced to live and work in the area.  In truth, the city in mid-June is no worse than Singapore during the early rainy season.  Which is not everyone's cup of tea, admittedly.
<P>Anyway, we have finished our Friday evening rituals.  My wife and I have gone to dinner, gone to temple, and returned.  The cats are fed and laze contentedly on the screen porch.  They eye the fireflies with vague interest.  A few stars peek through the silver clouds like dust motes.
<P>My wife eyes <I>me</I> with vague interest.  "Know what I feel like doing?"
<P>"What?" I say neutrally.  What she has in mind could be good or bad, so I'm keeping my options open.
<P>"I feel like..." she pauses for dramatic effect.  "Going to the beach."
<P>"The beach?  You mean, like Rehobeth Beach for the weekend?"
<P>"No.  I mean, the house in Buena Vistas."
<P>"Oh.  That's a good idea.  We haven't been there in a while."
<P>"Yes, and the weather tonight is perfect for it, don't you think?"
<P>"Okay, make some lemonade, then.  I'll get the gear."
