<P>About Lightspeed, now.
<P>Lightspeed is a game that did not, until recently, exist in the real world.  It was invented to be a virtual reality sport by a sporting goods corporation (Registry Protected) which had started out as a footwear manufacturer.  This shoe company -- er, excuse me, I mean "footwear" corporation -- expanded its line to include in-line rollerblades.  It has now expanded to be a mammoth sporting goods franchising operation.  Someone at high levels within this corporate behemoth decided that what they really needed to do, to stimulate sales of in-line rollerblades and associated protective equipment, was to create a new sport.  They could then license everything associated with this sport: not just equipment, but the games, the stadiums, the leagues, broadcast rights, collectibles, T-shirts, etcetera.
<P>It was a brilliant idea with one major problem.  Risk.  No one really knew whether an artificially created sport would catch on, and the penalty for failure would be massive losses.  So they came to the vCity in the hopes of test marketing the idea of the game before committing to setting it up in the real world.
<P>The game of Lightspeed borrows much from the game of Ultimate Disc and street hockey.  Played on a smooth, hard surface with rectangular dimensions of approximately 40m x 80m, each team of five skaters and one goaltender attempts to pass a disc from one to another and maneuver it towards the opponent's goal (also called a "net").  Flicking the disc past the goaltender and into the goal counts as scoring a point.  The first team to score 13 points wins the game; however, the winning team must win the game by at least 2 points.  A game cannot end by a score of 13-12 or 14-13, etcetera.
<P>The rules of the game are fundamentally simple.  While a player is in possession of the disc, that player may not skate but may roll using momentum (both feet must be touching the pavement at all times).  A player may attempt to pass the disc to a teammate at any time; if the disc touches the ground in the field of play for any reason, however, that is considered a "drop" or "turnover".  One player from the opposing team takes possession of the disc at the point of turnover.  A shot-on-goal results either in a score or, having been blocked or caught by the goaltender, a turnover to the goaltender.
<P>There are many other minor rules such as defining illegal body contact, out-of-bounds, and throw-offs after a goal has been scored, but that, in a nutshell, is how to play Lightspeed.
<P>In the virtual reality setting, this actually translates fairly well.  Each player dons a HMD and MSE gloves and slippers.  All twelve players "see" a virtual representation not just of the field, but on-line avatars of their teammates and opponents.  The "disc" they pass back and forth is represented by a rotating disc of multi-colored light.  The score is displayed for each player along with other additional information they may wish to know such as wind velocity, number of minutes opposing team players have been playing, completion percentages, goals scored, that kind of thing.
<P>I tried the game once and found it to be exceedingly irritating.  For one thing, I don't have the knack of "skating" down very well, at least not in a pair of VR slippers.  This is not so bad while standing still -- one can always pass off to a teammate -- but it is extraordinarily annoying while "in motion".  I discovered that I kept going out of bounds because, quite simply, I did not know how to stop.  And it is very embarrassing to go sliding out of bounds and then hear, or read, helpful comments from internetworked teammates such as "Shithead!" or "Asshole!"  Although there is a certain refreshing quality in listening to exotic curses in a foreign tongue.
<P>Virtual Lightspeed has proven to be enormously popular.  Almost immediately, enthusiasts formed a vLightspeed Association complete with schedules, hourly updated statistics, tournaments, and prizes.  I find all of this very strange and perhaps a little depressing.  Somehow in my mind, sport was always the last bastion of fellowship and camaraderie -- not to mention physical exercise.  Now people can play on team sports and yet be utterly alone; they can belong to a team whose members they will never meet, unless they make an extra effort to do so.  Is that a glimpse of the future?
<P>Perhaps not.  Once the sporting goods corporation discovered that it had a winner on its hands, it moved into full production and advertised the hell out of the new found sport of Lightspeed.  I've seen the game played on parking lots and deserted streets everywhere in the real world, and people -- especially kids -- seem to like it.  So perhaps I am just being an old fuddy-duddy, bemoaning as my forefathers did before me social innovations which I cannot understand and in which I do not wish to participate.
