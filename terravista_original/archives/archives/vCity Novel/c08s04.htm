<P>So my wife and I have this place in Buena Vistas.  To avoid unnecessary arguments with or flaming from the vHoi-Paloi, the zoning volume is not registered to the First Citizen but rather to Goldi Locke, which is my wife's vCity moniker.
<P>Ms. Locke is very lucky.  She owns the finest house with the finest view in Buena Vistas.  It's the massive white colonial on the hill on a spit of property that is the jutting end of the cape.  In this house, one can see the sun rise from beneath the ocean in the East and set below the Bay in the West.  There are trails that lead from the garden terrace and the porch down to the rocks and to the beach.  Plenty of excellent wind-protected ledges for a picnic.
<P>If this were a real world estate, its actual value would probably be somewhere between $10 and $20 million.  Taxes would also probably run about $500K a year.  In the world of make-believe, however, the whole site (which rests on a local server in the county public library) only costs us about $30 a year to maintain.
<P>It did, however, cost us about $500 to build the site, and another $1000 in HMD/MSE equipment.
<P>When I say "build" what I mean, of course, is "design".  We didn't actually do the VR work ourselves.  There are many, many "home builder" programs sold on the open market for about $40 -- our corporation even provides new citizens with some freeware -- that enable PC users to design VR worlds themselves.  But these are merely stick-figure shadows of what a trained architectural professional using a high-end system can achieve.
<P>Now, as it happened, one of my wife's friends in the real world <I>is</I> a real landscape and construction architect who does work with some very powerful modeling equipment.  So he offered to design a VR site for us at cost.  All we had to do was give him the parameters, and he would do the rest.  He knew how to program for HMD because he does this for real-world clients all the time.  He says that nobody contracts to build a house on spec any more without being able to walk through it before construction begins.  The cost of designing an HMD-based virtual blueprint was an out-of-pocket expense, he admitted, but his sales skyrocketed as a result of employing the technique.  Also, he saved money by giving the customers a shot at redesigning the house before setting the foundation.
<P>"Doesn't matter though," he once grumbled.  "The fuckers still change their minds half way through a project."
<P>So we paid him off and purchased a pair of HMD helmets.  All the really good equipment is made by the Japanese, naturally -- although to avoid import fees into North America, they end up manufacturing them in Mexico.  These things have all the bells and whistles: superb audio as well video control; ergonomically designed to ease eye and neck strain; and a whole bunch of extra PCS (Personal Communications Services) devices to clean up errant signals and other kinds of electronic noise.  What an HMD helmet allows one to do is link remotely (without wires) to a device that connects to whatever datapipe one has in the real world.  Whichever way one connects to the Internet -- by phone, by ISDN, by cable modem, by utility line, or by satellite dish -- this thing will give you a solid link.
<P>As we sit in our lounge chairs sipping lemonade, we are in two worlds at once.  There are some things which cannot be reproduced such as the smell and taste of salt air.  As a matter of fact, what we smell is not the tang of the ocean but the chlorine of the hot tub.  But then again, we can drown out the ever present drone of the cicadas and crickets with a nice CD (Compact Disc) of ocean sounds.  Tradeoffs.
<P>What I particularly like is the way our architect/programmer friend rigged the program so that whenever there was a sustained sound in the CD, it would trigger a scapp within this mini simulation.  So, for example, if one heard the cawing of a seagull, a picture of a seagull would float by on the display.
