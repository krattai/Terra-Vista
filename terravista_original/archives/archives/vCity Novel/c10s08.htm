<P>There were, however, some unexpected problems.  Lawn mowing services hated these things; a few unsavory businessmen paid employees to run around neighborhoods sabotaging them.  A few parents who had been careless with their PINs were appalled at the Jackson Pollack lawn results applied by children who considered nolomowers as merely another form of toy.  In one celebrated case, a disturbed individual needing serious psychiatric evaluation, whom police and journalists naturally dubbed "The Lawnmower Man," would chase neighbors, salespeople, and postal workers off his property by remote control with his nolomower.  He was eventually convicted of assault with a deadly weapon, but the jury could not decide whether it was assault with intent to kill or not.
<P>This latter case raised the horrific possibility that at some future point in time, other "nolo" technologies would be used to execute all sorts of criminal or terrorist activities at a distance.  If the controller were residing in a foreign country beyond the reach of law enforcement, what could police do?  Or what if the controller was working off of an untraceable Internet connection?  As of this writing, there are several drafts of legislation pending in the halls of Congress that would require registration of all "nolo" machinery and farm equipment, treating them as if they were weapons.
<P>It's kind of sad, but that's life.  Maybe we should follow the Japanese example, and plant rock gardens instead.
