<P>The beauty of becoming a vCitizen is that a new customer can do anything s/he wants to, as long as it fits within the boundaries of the simulation, which means the laws of physics as we currently understand them and zoning ordinances established by the Zoning Council.  All we ask, is that they be nice.  That, and to contribute towards their vision of what they want the future to become.
<P>We do offer people choices, of course.  It's a well known phenomenon that almost nobody wants to do in the vCity what they actually do in real life.  I don't know why that is.  Maybe I'm the only one in the real world who isn't stuck with a crappy job.  Or maybe the grass is brown on all sides of the fence.  Anyway we provide them with a list of 128 possible commercial or industrial sectors; they can choose from among those.
<P>More often than not, however, people come up with something new -- something that they've always wanted to do, but never had the time or the investment capital to do or build.  This, of course, is one of the most important reasons our corporation created the vCity in the first place.  We watch and we learn what is hot and what is not.  That gives us a two year lead for most product developments, and two years is all it takes to squeeze most of the profit out of a market niche before competition arises and margins disappear.  Or, if it's a product or service we don't know how to produce and sell, we set up a market survey for one of our transnational partners who might.
<P>Why do people think I and other members of the Zoning Council inspect the vCity on a daily basis?  Because we're busybodies?  No, no -- because we are <I>businessbuddies</I>.  Here's the point: anyone can inspect the vCity, right?  So our corporation has no real advantage against any other corporation looking for new products.  The difference is that we can establish a rapport with customers before our competitors can.  We can help new vCitizens set up simmcorps, and discuss with these new vCitizens some of the advantages and disadvantages of their business concepts.
