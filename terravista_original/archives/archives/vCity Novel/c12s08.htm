<P>I could wander around the International Airport for hours looking at things.  There is so much to click on and investigate.  I must say, these guys have really gotten into it.
<P>"What the hell do you do with all of this stuff?" I once asked one of the designers, an ex-NASA guy from Langley Research Center, who still lives in the Hampton, VA area.
<P>"Oh, we just have fun with it.  You know how it is with the cutbacks and all.  The only thing left to do is virtual reality, because the government doesn't want to spend money on real reality any more."
<P>"Did it ever?"
<P>"Ha!  Well, listen, it's not all goofing off.  We use it to showcase some of our ideas to airports around the country.  Picked up about ten million dollars in business that way."
<P>"<I>Ten million?</I>" I echoed incredulously.
<P>"Well, yeah," he replied defensively, misunderstanding me.  "Look, it may not be much, but it feeds the bulldog."
<P>"Oh, I'm not complaining, Jimbo.  I'm astonished.  How much did it cost you to design the techsimm?"
<P>"About $300K, plus or minus.  Why?"
<P>"Nothing.  Listen, I have an idea for you, free of charge."
<P>"Go ahead."
<P>"Why don't you attach flight simulator software as a subsimm, and charge people to 'fly' aircraft around the area?  I'm sure there are some <I>mapps</I> of the vCity you could use, even if they were only updated once a month or so."
<P>"Ha!  Way ahead of you," he replied smugly.  "We're already negotiating with a major game company to do just that."
<P>"Well, no dogfighting, please," I replied sourly.  "Aerial combat among citizens is not a sustainable civilization."
<P>"It is if you have enough air-to-air missiles."
<P>"Maybe.  But it's not a desirable future."
