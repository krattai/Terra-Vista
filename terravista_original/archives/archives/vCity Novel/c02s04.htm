<P>	<I>Exon Inspiration</I> is a nightmare.  It's a movable, interactive Bosch painting.  Being PC-based as I am, I can only mostly observe various sexual activities taking place, ranging from the sublime to the ridiculous.  From a purely technical standpoint, I have to admit that the 3D is excellent.  Whoever designed this put in a lot of time and effort.
<P>	The PC-based interactivity is shallow.  In one room, the visitor is given a range of gender options and a menu of body types, and is allowed to "participate" in twosomes, threesomes, and N-somes.  In the PC-based version, what this amounts to is observing one's own avatar and either dominating or submitting to numerous carnal choices with scapps and possibly other avatars.
<P>	I think I would be apprehensive about trying out the HMD or MSE versions.  In addition to stimulation and penetration of every imaginable orifice with various organs, limbs, and devices, I see also bondage, bestiality, child molestation, rape, torture, and murder.
<P>	That isn't even the worst part, though, from a conceptual viewpoint.
<P>	In one area, one can engage in sex with moving <I>body parts</I>.  Seeing a floating, pulsating penis build a memory with an undulating, gaping vagina puts a whole new spin on the concept of T&A.
<P>	I've seen enough.
<P>	Back at the front entrance, the bouncer scapp has been replaced by a leather-bedecked, whip-equipped amazon dominatrix who informs me that the charges are $29.99 plus applicable sales tax and have been automatically deducted from my checking account.
<P>	Not quite, madam.
<P>	The scapp smiles.  "Come again. . .and again!"
<P>	I am returned to the third floor of the <I>Sage Advice</I>.
