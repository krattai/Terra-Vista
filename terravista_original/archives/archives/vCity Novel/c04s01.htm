In my e-mail there is a letter from "Lee Ward".  S/he writes:<BR>

<BR>
<B>Thank you for your recent note about my new site at Sage Advice.
<P>
Exon Inspiration is merely interactive art applied to the free market.<BR>
If people do not wish to go there, they don't have to.<BR>
<P>
As for the body parts, I thought that was rather a neat statement<BR>
summarizing the raw elemental nature of sex from the point of<BR>
view of the id.<BR>
<P>
Thanks also for your offer of employment.  I like the job I have.<BR>
Lee<BR>
</B>
<P>
I groan inwardly.  This is going to be a nasty one, no doubt about it.  There is nothing more intransigent than an artist defending art for the sake of freedom of expression; nothing more dangerous, unless one gets between a baby hippopotamus and its mother.
<P>Yet there is no point hiding or even wasting time.  I learned long ago that crafting a response for e-mail is a waste of time.  On the Net one has to speak one's mind, speak one's heart, and let the truth prevail.  If truth can be found.

RE: Wherefore art?<BR>
<P>
Lee:<BR>
<P>
Art speaks to the human condition, and, more than technology, is our<BR>
last and best hope for progress.<BR>
<P>
The hallmark of civilization is that while we recognize our capacity<BR>
for evil, we nevertheless renounce it and work towards a better future.<BR>
<P>
Your site graphically portrays sadism, rape, torture, and murder.  Okay,<BR>
others have done so in other media before you.  Because your site<BR>
is interactive, however, it enlists the participation of others to engage,<BR>
even if only conceptually, in such cruelties.  By charging fees to<BR>
others for participating, you thereby assign value to dehumanization.<BR>
And you make no attempt to renounce the evil you display.<BR>
In the arena of the spirit, silence is consent.<BR>
<P>
In short, I believe that you have moved beyond art into exploitation<BR>
for profit.  This is not a good thing.<BR>
<P>
Respectfully,<BR>
First Citizen<BR>
</B>
<P>I barely sit down to enjoy my first cup of coffee of the day, a good, strong French Roast, when Lee replies.  S/he must be staying up late at the keyboard.  I am delighted.  The more e-mail I can get from Lee, the more chance I have of obtaining something that I can use.  In the world of infodemocracy, discourse is water.  It makes life possible.  S/he replies:
<P>
<B>
[snip]<BR>
<P>
But that's the point.  Don't you see?  You talk about<BR>
'evil' and 'good' as if these were objective criteria.<BR>
But they're not.  You have to let people decide for<BR>
themselves what constitutes 'good' and 'evil'.<BR>
<P>
Lee<BR>
</B>
<P>I can feel the coffee churning in my stomach.  This is really going to be a tough one.  If Lee had told me, in good Australian fashion, to go piss off, I would be happier.  Instead, I've stepped into an oozing black tar pit of moral relativism; Ethics 101.
<P>At any rate, s/he has given me the wedge I need.

When the Nazis threw Jews by the trainload into the gas chambers,<BR>
the Nazis were working with a subjective criteria of good and evil.<BR>
Allies from around the world kicked their ass anyway.<BR>

Let people decide?  Okay, see you in the Court of Public Opinion.<BR>
