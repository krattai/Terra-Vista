<P>Buena Vistas is a virtual reality beach.  On the conceptual map of the vCity, it is located about two hundred kilometers east from the vCity center.  Geographically it is a cape and borders on both The Bay and The Ocean.  Buena Vistas is a suburb but it has no light rail station; the only way to get there is to drive an EPWV (Engine-Powered Wheeled Vehicle), take a ferry or a sailboat, fly a helicopter, dirigible, or ultralite personal aircraft or -- for the true New Millennite -- <I>beam</I> there.
<P>If Buena Vistas were in the real world, it would be enormously expensive property.  Imagine every ritzy coastal area you've ever seen minus the teeming masses and not-so-fine hotels.  No highrise apartment buildings to mar the view.  Plenty of dunes and wildlife refuges; no industry.
<P>When we first established the zoning ordinances for Buena Vistas, we knew that everyone would want a piece of this action.  There are very few people who would pass up a free opportunity to own a few hectares of beachfront and a mansion overlooking the sea, with no worries about property damage caused by the relentless force of wind, salt, tide, and time.
<P>Coastal and tidal areas are, however, even more fragile ecosystems than deserts.  That may sound odd, but it's true.  Where land meets sea, life rejoices; this fringe teems with diversity of all creatures, and it is a paradise of evolutionary fervor.  Change a few minor variables, however, and the system crashes.  From algae to seabird, life says "there goes the neighborhood" and sells out, leaving humans to sandbag their way through a miserable soda-can strewn existence.
<P>Human presence demands much of an ecosystem.  We need fresh water, electric power, and a means to recycle or otherwise dispose of waste products of all kinds.  There are ways to cut down on pollution per capita, but we can only modify the basic formula that pollution is proportional to human population density.
<P>So what's a Zoning Council to do?  Frankly, we decided to deliberately limit the population density of Buena Vistas by reserving huge chunks of it as wildlife refuge; the remaining zoning volumes were restricted to large lots and large homes.  Some of these parcels were reserved for registry by lottery, so that we could democratically satisfy the excess of demand over supply without resorting to "selling" virtual real estate.  The remaining parcels were assigned on a first-request first-assign basis.
<P>The wisdom of this became apparent within three weeks of opening the vCity to the general internetworking public.  We were immediately swamped with requests for immense tracts of beachfront CCs.  Not a few people were incensed with the fact that when they applied for residence in Buena Vistas, they ended up with a registry for Unpretentious to the south or Townhouse Row to the west, where cheap summer cottages, beach bungalows, ocean highrises  and by-the-Bay six-story condos were permitted.
