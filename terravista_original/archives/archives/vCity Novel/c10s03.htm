<P>In the nations of North America, in Australia, in South Africa, and in Brazil, the positive benefit of "telecommuting" was no so much economic as it was environmental.  People drove less.  The amount of driving was not reduced considerably -- perhaps 10% in all -- but the significant point was that it was <I>reduced</I>.  In a civilization choking on its own addiction to gasoline-burning automobiles, this was the great unheralded revolution of fin-de-siècle Earth.  It gave everyone connected to the 20th century transportation industry a little breathing space to redesign and refurbish their roads, tunnels, bridges, and other capital investments.  And it is giving the EPWV industry time to think things out.
<P>The vCity did not prove any of this out directly, of course.  Just as we went to a significant expense to design a mass transit simm, we went to even greater expense to design a complete EPWV infrastructure simm.  More on that fantasy some other time.  The bottom line is that people didn't really use <I>that</I> either.  It's impossible to force people to use it when they can <I>beam</I>.  We could have arbitrarily prevented <I>beaming</I>, of course, and forced people to scroll from one part of the city to another via a transit simm, but what good would that have done except to piss vCitizens and tourists off?  What good is a simulation, if all it does is reproduce what we insist should happen?
<P>No indeed, it turned out that the anti-medium <I>was</I> the anti-message.  There's a reason people don't spend an hour scrolling in a vAutomobile to get from one place to another in the vCity.  It's a pain in the tushie.  Which is precisely why most people don't want to do it in real life, either.
