"Electronic entertainment is mass playtime in mass culture at a peak moment of feculent commercialism."

<P>	It had to happen sooner or later.  But even given that probability analysis, I am nevertheless surprised to discover that it has happened sooner rather than later.  I have stumbled upon a virtual reality whorehouse.  A vBordello, as it were.
<P>	The time is late, probably after midnight.  It doesn't matter.  I am feeling Newtonian in my need for a temporal frame of reference.  Call it 02:15 for the sake of argument.
<P>	I'm on inspection duty.  In the vCity there are no police, there cannot be police.  I am not the police.
<P>	 ("Men?  <I>Police</I>-Men?")
<P>	Instead, I am the polis.  I make my rounds only to observe.  I give advice.  If necessary, I post concerns about vCity sites to the Goodwill Division.
<P>	The GD almost always solves the problem by the relentless force of its combined persuasion.  If it cannot persuade, it isolates via boycott.  Social disapproval can render most vCitizens into quivering apologetic masses of protoplasm.
<P>	But sometimes even the GD is not enough.  Then I must consider calling for banishment.  	The <I>banned</I> no longer exist within the walls of the vCity.  And there are no walls to the vCity.  The <I>banned</I> are exiles, outcasts.  They live.  They are free to do what they wish.  But they are not linked to the vCity.  Their names are no more.
<P>	There are very few with the corporate authority to call for a <I>ban</I>.  I take it very seriously.
<P>	When the vCity was first zoned, we knew that zoning was meaningless.  Only voluntary cooperation could separate order from chaos.  That is why we set up the underside, which we called Belowtown.
<P>	Belowtown was divided into two sectors called Grunge and Mole.  It was set aside for the knights and pages of anti-civilization.  Strangely enough, the denizens of Belowtown turned out to be the most peaceful anarchists of all.  It was as if they understood that this was truly their place, where all laws remained unwritten.  I love them dearly.  They are my people, these paradoxi.  Codebreakers who never break the Code.
<P>	No, tonight I am not in Belowtown.  I have wandered casually into Uptown, in Confluencia, to see what passes for entertainment among the people.
