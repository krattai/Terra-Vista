<P>	This requires some research which I can easily do at my desktop.  As the keeper of the Archives, I can go anywhere, delve into any file, within the simulation. The <I>Exon Inspiration</I> has existed for 19 days.  The name of the vCitizen to whom the <I>Exon Inspiration</I> CCs are registered is Lee Ward.  S/he has an e-mail address that looks to be an educational site -- the real University in Sydney, if I'm not mistaken -- in Australia.  The SLIP/PPP server address s/he is using to collect tele-income, however, is located in the Bahamas.
<P>	There is not much I will do at this early point except post an e-letter:

RE: Exon Inspiration<BR>
<P>
"Lee":<BR>
Regarding the Exon Inspiration, the First Amendment to the U.S. constitution<BR>
does not protect pornography.  Since you are located in Australia and your<BR>
VR files are located on a server in the Bahamas, however,<BR>
this is probably irrelevant to you.<BR>
<P>
To be honest, there isn't any action we, as a U.S.-based corporation,<BR>
can take short of pulling the plug on you.  For both PR and legal reasons,<BR>
we prefer not to do this.<BR>
<P>
Therefore, let us try a different approach.  Allow us to reason with you.<BR>
<P>
The vCity was established to provide our corporation with a marketing tool<BR>
to engage people, both our customers and other net users,<BR>
in a continuing multilogue about the future.  Quite simply, we want<BR>
to know what our customers want, to serve their needs and interests better.<BR>
Owing to the long lead time for some project development,<BR>
it helps us to know these market demands in advance.<BR>
Also, by engaging our customers in a multilogue early, we can get them<BR>
to provide input prior to product launch.<BR>
<P>
Your site, linked through Confluencia ZV:(+)17/(-)190/(+)84, is technically quite proficient.<BR>
You should consider contacting our human resources representative in Sydney<BR>
about possible employment with the corporation or one of our many transnational partner firms.<BR>
<P>
The subject matter leaves much to be desired, however.<BR>
Is this really the kind of future you desire?  A dehumanizing pleasure economy?<BR>
A world in which people consider other people as body parts to be exploited,<BR>
abused, and ultimately destroyed?<BR>
<P>
My personal opinion, for what it is worth, is that while your VR form is very beautiful,<BR>
its substance leaves no room for advancement of the human spirit.<BR>
I find it difficult to believe that God placed us here on Earth<BR>
in order to engage in idle debasement.<BR>
<P>
Sincerely,<BR>
First Citizen<BR>
vCity<BR></B>
<P>
Meanwhile, I post a short missive to the GD Board:<BR>

RE: Zoning Violation Referendum<BR>
<P>
By the corporate authority vested in me on 01 OCT 97, 00:01 EST, section VI,<BR>
subsection IX, paragraph 4.1, I hereby call a referendum of the citizens of the vCity<BR>
to determine if the city coordinates (as attached) known as the Exon Inspiration<BR>
shall be considered in violation of the zoning instructions for<BR>
the Confluencia zoning volume in which it resides.<BR>
