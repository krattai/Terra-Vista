<P>	With an HMD and a good set of earphones, the outback is a very special place to visit.  The CPSDE sells a one-hour guided tour of the ecosystem, supplemented with sound, for $6.49 plus tax.  That's a real bargain in terms of education / entertainment value.  At first I thought that was kind of corny, selling a VR experience when people could enjoy the real thing for free.  But early on I changed my mind.  Not everyone lives within easy walking distance of a desert.  And even then, do they really know what they're looking at?  Or what to look for?
<P>	I asked the director at CPSDE why he didn't just put the same information tour on a CD-ROM or a video cassette and sell those.  Turns out that they did, and lost money on them.  He told me that the vCity ecosimm was the only multimedia package that made money for the simple reason that it did not require shipping and handling.  CD-ROMs and cassettes are cheap to manufacture, but they cannot easily be updated once they are mailed out.  The vCity ecosimm, on the other hand, could be updated continuously on the CPSDE server.  As a matter of fact, he added, the continuously changing nature of the simulation is what makes it unique, and why people keep coming back for second and third visits at $6.49 a pop.
<P>	What about the PC-based version, I asked him.  Did that sell, too?
<P>	"Nah," he responded.  "We <I>give</I> that away.  Nobody really wants to sit and mouse- scroll through a herky-jerky desert simm on a PC when they can eat popcorn and watch a high-rez Nature video.  HMD's the thing."
<P>	"You ought to cut a deal with headset manufacturers," I told him.
<P>	A long silence filled the other end of the phone.  "Well, no comment," he explained.

<P>	The desert in eternal dawn.  There is symbolism in there somewhere.
