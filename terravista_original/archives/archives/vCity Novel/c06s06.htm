<P>A very odd thing happened with PAFA, though.  It turned out that people were more interested in watching the activities of the virtual league then in answering marketing surveys.  PAFA got the information the real world cartel wanted, but it also discovered that vCitizens were flocking to the virtual games by the millions.  The simulation, as it turned out, was more interesting, fast-paced, affordable and accessible than the real sport itself.  It began to generate income.  Real world owners were delighted, since they did not have to deal with player unions.  We got a <I>very</I> nasty letter from the real world players unions, however.  Their letter was <I>nothing</I> compared to the vitriolic missives we were getting from the banks that owned real world stadiums and the television networks that were broadcasting real world games.  They were petrified that vSports would cut into viewer share and stadium attendance.  This was all settled out of court two years ago.  I'm not at liberty to disclose the terms of the agreement.  Bottom line?  Plenty of pie for everyone.
<P>When other sports corporations saw what was going on, they also clamored for the "right" to develop simms at the S & E.  We cut deals with them all.  I can't go into the details of those contracts either, except to say that the annual revenue we receive in total from them alone is about sixty times the cost of running the vCity.
<P>The Planetary Baseball League (a simmcorp fronting for a Registry Protected real world cartel) paid for the design of vCity <B>Ballpark Number One</B>.  It is also luxurious by any standard featuring identical services to those mentioned previously, except the baseball stadium seats only 48,430, has fewer luxury suites and parking spaces, and has no internal hotel.  Exterior design resembles "turn-of-the-century" architecture similar to Fenway Park.  Box seats very close to the field.  Adjustable inner and outer fences and movable "brick and ivy" wall.  Robot-hand-operated "old style" scoreboard at playing field level.  "Virtual" laser-sight foul poles automatically determine fair/foul balls and home-runs; "virtual" laser-sight strike zone takes guesswork out of horizontal axis (home plate umpire still judges "high" or "low" pitches).  All seats equipped with interactive audio/video displays so that fans may review replays and box scores, update statistics and scorecards, and register their electoral opinion as "official scorer" for hits versus errors, wild pitches versus passed balls, etc.
<P>The PBL took their league one step further, and encouraged vCitizens to develop their own teams and leagues.  It all became a weird blend of rotisserie baseball and real world television-based baseball.  Sometimes when I pass by a real world storefront and see a baseball game on a screen, I honestly don't know what the hell I'm looking at.  Is it real reality, or is it virtual reality?  Does it make a difference?  It's all business reality.
<P>With the success of the PAFA and PBL, the floodgates opened.  Now the S & E Complex has a Coliseum, vCity Ice Arena, vCity Water Arena, The Courts, The Lanes, vGolf Courses 1 through 12 (very popular with our Japanese vCitizenry), Woodhills Park (a vDisc Golf Course), a Rifle & Pistol Range, and Pineforest Park (a vKriegspiel arena, very popular with males of all ages).  The vSports displayed include indoor football, soccer, lacrosse, jai-lai, ultimate disc, competitive cycling, ice hockey, other ice sports & entertainment, basketball, volleyball, racquetball, handball, wallyball, gymnastics, wrestling, sumo wrestling, boxing, martial arts, fencing, swordfighting, dancing, tennis, double disc court, racquet sports of all kinds, nine and ten pin bowling, archery, swimming, diving, and water polo.
