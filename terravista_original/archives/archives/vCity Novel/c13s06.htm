<P>We encouraged the vCitizens to come up with ideas for generating electricity using appropriate technologies.  That meant, especially in densely populated areas, non-polluting machinery.  The people responded enthusiastically, and they are thinking up new ways all the time.  I already mentioned the guy who wanted to generate electricity from eels.
<P>The most socially efficient form of generating electricity, as many people showcased on their VR sites, is to use human power.  By sitting on a contraption that looks very much like an exercise bicycle stand, a human can generate small amounts of current on the order of 10-20 watts simply by spinning magnets.  This is, technically, an inefficient way to generate large amounts of electricity.  One would have to line 40 people up in a row just to get the microwave oven going.  Socially, however, it is extremely efficient because it provides so many social benefits.  First of all, it places the ability to generate electricity direct into the, er, legs of the individual.  It is the ultimate in decentralization of power.  Secondly, it can be done anytime, virtually anywhere, and with very low capital investment, to reduce individual demands upon the overall power system.  And best of all, it allows humans to convert unwanted fat calories into kilowatts.  The health care benefits of regular exercise are enormous, especially in a future where people will mostly sit around on their buttinskis pushing electrons all day.
<P>Many people also set up VR sites to demonstrate the potential of other sustainable, renewable sources of power generation such as wind, water, and thermal differentials.  Their ideas were a little bit more capital intensive, but perfectly legitimate from a technical point of view.  None of them were <I>banned</I>.
