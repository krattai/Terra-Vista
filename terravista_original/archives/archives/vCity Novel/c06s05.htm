<P>The GLC is a special kind of simmcorp, since it represents both real world corporations "fronting" in the vCity, as well as real world vendors selling and testing ideas by masquerading as vCity corporations.  There is plenty of volume open to development of new facilities; the cartel is open to all comers.  If it were a real world venture, in return for rent-free use of city real estate, the GLC would donate a fixed percentage of all profits to local general revenue funds.  As it is, our corporation just lets the GLC run itself and hang out for free.  All we ask is that they be nice.
<P>We knew from the start that the S&E would be used as a testing device for real world analogs, and we were not disappointed.  The whole idea of the vCity as a marketing tool was, after all, to serve as a testbed for concepts too expensive and risky to test market in the real world.
<P>One obvious example was the Planetary American Football Association.  PAFA is a simmcorp that serves as a front for a real world American Football cartel (Registry protected).  The real world corporation behind PAFA approached our corporation with the idea of setting up a virtual league with virtual players and virtual schedules.  Naturally they also needed a virtual stadium.  This one contract netted us $500K in real money, which back in 1997 was a lot of dough.
<P>The vCity <B>Stadium Number One</B> is luxurious by any standard.  This cutting edge, beyond-state-of the-art facility seats 80,570 tushies.  "Intelligent" climate control and soil drainage.  Robotic maintenance.  Fully retractable "skydome" for year-round use.  Natural grass.  Liquidgel-stabilization foundation dampens harmonic vibrations and prevents damage from earthquakes.  Retractable sound dampeners.  362 luxury suites ("skyboxes") rented throughout the year on a highest-bidder basis.  No bad seats or obstructed views in the place.  42 remote-control-operated cameras.  Press area contains satellite uplink.  All seats provide adjustable cushioning, cup/bottle holder, audio/video and ISDN input/output jacks, and plenty of leg room.  High-definition, large and split-screen monitors everywhere.  More bathrooms per person than any other stadium ever designed.  Excellent food, beverage, and concession services at very reasonable prices.  Internal shopping mall, hotel, and gardens.  Excellent access for physically challenged.  Special cybernetic augmentation services available for visual/hearing impaired.  Infant and child care centers available.  Free parking.
<P>Utopian?  Of course, that was the point.  The idea was to try and find out what people thought would be essential, nice-to-have, or goofy.  Because no sports cartel, construction developer, city, or bank in its right mind would ever build this thing without doing a market analysis through the wazoo, and even then they'd be leveraged up to their eyeballs for six generations.  With that kind of risk, they'd need some kind of assurance, and that was what the vCity S&E was designed to give them.
