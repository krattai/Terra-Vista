<P>We estimated, when we first set up the vCity infrastructure, that the average single-family home by the year 2010 A.D. would have 5-10 telecomm connections of one form or another including frequency (wireless) receiver/transmitter, satellite receiver, and metal wire and optical (cable) receiver/transmitters.  We knew that they would perform different functions at different rates, but what they would all have in common would be the manipulation of digital data.  We guessed that telecomm connections would carry information to and from the city on the conditions of the house, the financial status of the owner, the medical status of the inhabitants, as well as text, voice, audio/video/holo, and real-time interactive telepresence.
<P>Not surprisingly, some of this came to pass by the year 2002.  We saw it happen in the vCity itself.  After the Deregulation fever epidemic of 1995-98, which began in the United States and spread quickly to all parts of the globe, the number of telecomm corporations jumped to -- at last count -- 317.  Many of these established simmcorps in the vCity, to advertise their wares and services.  Of these, more than 75% are engaged in networking and long-distance carrying.  The remainder are a mixture of software and hardware producing, distribution, and retail firms.
<P>Today, there are 23 full-service transnational telecomm conglomerates that compete for every bit (pun intended) of business everywhere, all the time.  Naturally, we like to think of ourselves as the best.  This public service announcement brought to you by the boys and girls at Corporate Public Relations.
<P>I can remember when, after The Great Deregulation, people back <I>then</I> thought that television advertising was irritating.  That was a <I>morgue</I> compared to the multicolored bazaar of today.
<P>Fortunately, the vCitizens came to the rescue.  One of the vCitizens of Grunge (the other Belowtown sector) invented "blather-reduction" software and distributed it freely through the vCity Data Freewarehouse.  So now it is possible to screen out and ignore unbidden advertisements.  As a matter of fact, we sell a similar software package called <B>Sheket</B> (Copyright) for only $4.95 plus applicable sales tax.  Funny how it never seems to work on <I>our</I> infomarketing, though.
