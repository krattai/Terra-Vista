<P>It was like accidentally knocking down a hornet's nest.  I remember very well how university administrators came flying at us from every direction, more juiced than a bunch of Yellow Jackets nursing from a can of Jolt cola.  Threatened to sue our corporation for something or other -- I don't think their lawyers were ever very clear about what, certainly ours were mystified -- and ended up blacklisting anyone who participated in VCIU.  They twisted the arms of corporations not to treat a VCIU degree as a legitimate degree and waged a vicious disinformation campaign against the value of electronically-based research and education.  There was even a lobbying effort on Capitol Hill to get Congress to apply taxes to universities which "did not own physical facilities".
<P>It was all a magnificent failure, indeed, a textbook case of how to foment a PR disaster.  The more advertising and lobbying money the universities threw at the problem, the worse it got.  All they were doing was purchasing huge gobs of negative publicity.
<P>Undergraduate students began to seriously weigh their needs -- those who were not treating college life as a four-year jaunt paid for by their parents, that is -- and decided that it was cheaper to buy a PC and get an Internet connection and join a tele-university.
<P>Foreign governments quickly latched on to the notion that it was far better to have their students learn from people in the developed nations than to have their best brains drained to the developed nations.  Indeed, by opening up a virtual university, they could keep home-grown professors, too.  Not a year after VCIU opened, Singapore opened its own virtual university, followed quickly by the vUniversity of Cape Town in South Africa.
<P>Professors broke ranks in droves.  Not the tenured ones, of course, but the vast numbers of graduate students and journeyman scholars and assistant professors who suddenly realized that they did not have to move to some obscure part of the globe in order to earn a living wage.  Even more revolutionary: the idea that wages were roughly commensurate with teaching ability and/or actual knowledge.
