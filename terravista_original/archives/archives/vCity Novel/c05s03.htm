<P>I go over to one of the vKiosks chosen at random to see what the nowlinks are saying.  It is a simple shack called <I>Rasheed's</I>.  Rasheed (I don't know if that is a real name or not, but it doesn't really matter -- in the vCity, we have a saying: "It may be virtual, but it's still reality") sells nowlinks in Arabic, English, and Hebrew.  Looking down at the titles, I see nothing familiar and move on to the next vKiosk.  This one is called <I>L'Enfant Terrible</I> and sells an amazing variety of nowlinks, downloads, and mapps.  After searching for a minute, I finally see the name of a familiar nowlink, a golden oldie titled <I>Rainforest Mac</I>.
<P><I>Rainforest Mac </I> is still one of the more respectable nowlinks around, in its fifth year of operation.  The editor/publisher is a woman whom I actually know in the real world, a bicycle courier by day and a hellion by night.  She is a tough, no-nonsense ass-kicker who wouldn't hesitate to say exactly what she was thinking.  She was one of the earliest vCitizens to claim residence in an outland region, instead of building a vHome in the domain of the vCity proper.  She spent four months (so she claims) designing a palatial vHome, nestled in an upland valley of the Jungle/Rainforest outland.  I couldn't bring myself to scold her for choosing such magnificent and pristine isolation.  When one's real world consists of paved hell, why not dream in rainforest heaven?
<P>The answer being that it isn't a realistic option for the real world.  The whole purpose of the vCity as a social-political simulation is to try to conceive a sustainable future, and then go there.  The Jungle/Rainforest experts had fits about her.  A whole e-mail war broke out over that damn site; I learned more than I wanted to know about the fragility of rainforests.  Eventually we refused to zone a road out that far, especially in light of the fact that people could <I>beam</I> to her city coordinate if they wanted to.  But we did accept her dirigible/helipad.
<P>Anyway, <I>Rainforest Mac</I> was born.  If anyone would notice my post to the Goodwill Division, it would be MacKenzie.

Meanwhile, once again the vPopuli are being treated<BR>
to a splendid example of how the First Cherub likes<BR>
to take the flaming sword and wield it to keep<BR>
VR entrepreneurs from returning to Eden to<BR>

What is wrong with Lee Ward's <I>Exon Inspiration</I> [link now]<BR>
other than its execrable content?  Why is it a violation of the<BR>
Confluencia [link now] zoning ordinances?<BR>
<P>
vPopuli, I strongly urge you to vote no in the upcoming referendum.<BR>
I'm not advocating the site, I'm advocating my rights and your rights<BR>
as vCitizens to create and examine the content we choose.<BR>
