<P>The R.A.T. on the other hand was designed to do one thing and do it well: move large masses of people continuously from one high-density area to another and to places where traffic flow is the highest.  Our studies showed that the R.A.T. would be expensive to maintain and upgrade, but cheaper than dealing with the environmental and social disaster that would result from not having one.
<P>There are three R.A.T "lines" with two intrasystem transfer points at Confluencia and <A HREF="cityce01.htm">City Centre</A>.  The River or "R" line stretches from West Affordable to South Dawn Row.  The Airport or "A" line stretches from the vCity Regional Airport to River Heights.  And the Bay or "B" line runs from <A HREF="cityce01.htm">City Centre</A> to the Seaport Complex.  The typical train for off-peak hours holds four cars; during rush hours and when traffic conditions warrant, trains are boosted to 6-8 cars.
<P>R.A.T. cars are marvels of conceptual technology, designed and manufactured by the USNIWA Corporation (a simmcorp) with both manufacturing plants and headquarters in the vCity.  USNIWA <I>Wa</I> cars have a total capacity of 220 people mostly because they don't have too many seats.  They are designed for the convenience of the system and not necessarily for the user.  Limited access for the physically challenged, for example.  However, wherever possible, they have a few nice touches, including: "intelligent" passenger safety systems that prevent door accidents; wireless comm augmentation links for uninterrupted telecomm service while passing through tunnels and underground; directional video displays (for advertising & infotainment); superb climate and air quality controls (including scent manipulation); and liquid-gel stabilization compartments for smooth rides.  <I>Wa</I> cars are built to last and are designed for robotic maintenance.  They are powered by electric third rail and are equipped with twin drive engines capable of a maximum safe speed of 85 kph.  Emergency LiH batteries can supply enough power to move the train to the next station in the event of a network power outage.  Each car is autodirectional and has an invisible "nolo cab," where the "crewperson" actually sits in a room in R.A.T Centre and runs the train televisually.
<P>R.A.T. stations are designed for both passenger convenience and safety, as well as crowd control.  There are no "packers" to stuff people into a car because the train platforms are separated from the waiting areas.  Multiple gates "count" the correct number of people and act as membranes between the two areas.  Therefore, while some crowding can occur before the gates, none occurs afterwards.
<P>Well, almost none.  The system isn't perfect because it involves human beings -- for some reason, people, even in PC-based mode, have a tendency to want to go to specific cars, usually at either end of the platform.  This accounts for the occasionally tiresome delays as pleasant artificial voices remind weary human beings that "space is available in other cars on the train."
<P>Of course, all of this is utopian simm.  No money actually is transmitted, and in a VR world, the network itself is the mass transit system.
<P>So what did all of our fine efforts get us?  The vCitizenry urinated upon the concept from a great altitude.  They mocked the Light Rail as "rail lite" ("same great service as heavy rail, but only a third of the cost").  And they nicknamed the R.A.T. underground platforms "ratholes."
<P>Oh well.  We have a saying in the vCity business: "you can't make people simm."  It's hard to gauge the efficacy of a transportation concept in a virtual world where people can <I>beam</I> anywhere they like, anytime, with zero risk of death or injury to themselves (except the occasional lapse into MSE-induced barfogenia).
<P>I still like using the RAT, though, and so do some others.  According to our stats, it's still popular among Belgian, Dutch, German, Japanese, Korean, Singaporean, and Taiwanese vCitizens, all genders, ages 35+.  And we have an unshakable core of support from railroad enthusiasts worldwide -- enough to sell advertising to that community.  So the mass transit system techsimm rattles onwards, stuck forever in its soon-to-be-obsolete PC-based mode.
