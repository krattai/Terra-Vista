"Choice manifests itself in society in small increments and moment-to-moment decisions as well as in loud dramatic struggles; and he who does not see choice in the development of the machine merely betrays his incapacity to observe cumulative effects until they seem completely external and impersonal."

<P>Flashback.  When the Zoning Council first started working on the rules for the vCity simulation, we recognized that we would have to make some fundamental technological choices about what systems the vCity would provide.  Conceptually, therefore, we were in a box canyon from the get-go, because the flaw in all simulations is that they can only reproduce what the program allows them to reproduce.  In other words, to use a tired old cliché, "garbage in, garbage out."
<P>I had a devil of a time convincing my superiors -- and I use that term loosely -- to create an open-ended simulation that allowed the users themselves to change the infrastructure over time.  It was the only way I could see out of the trap.
<P>I told them the old story of the wealthy man who refused to give to charity.  The rabbi beckoned him over to a glass window and said, "look out -- what do you see?"
<P>"I see the world," said the rich man.
<P>"Now look at this mirror.  What do you see?"
<P>"I see myself."
<P>The rabbi shook his head.  "Amazing, isn't it?  Cover clear glass with a little silver, and you see only yourself."
<P>I argued that the corporation could not afford to create a virtual reality setting that only our corporation wanted to see.  That would be worse, I explained, than believing our own press releases.  At that point I saw some of the light bulbs began to click on.
<P>Still, the point of the vCity was to investigate future markets before they developed, and so to some extent the virtual reality had to mimic real reality.  But <I>which</I> reality?  That is to say, given a choice of competing technological, political, social, and economic systems, which ones to choose for the initial settings?  It didn't matter, I argued, as long as we allowed the users to change it later.  Start with North American information age capitalist democracy if you must.  Just make sure that anything our users come up with later does not defy the laws of physics as we understand them.  Force them to explain themselves, and learn from them.
