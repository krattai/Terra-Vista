<P>The first phone call came from a reporter working on a story for <I>Business Tomorrow</I>.  I forgot to ask him whether that was a newspaper, news magazine, or a radio or television news program, but it doesn't really matter.  He seemed interested in the referendum process.
<P>"So, you say that people can vote more than once?"
<P>"Technically, yes.  Each person with an e-mail address that is registered in our database is allowed one vote.  So if a person is registered more than once, they can vote more than once.  But. . ."
<P>"Do you think that is fair?"
<P>"Well, actually yes.  What I was going to say was, most people don't vote at all."
<P>"Oh is that right?  What's the typical percentage of voter turn-out?"
<P>"About 30%.  More on very controversial issues."
<P>"Why is it fair to allow people to skew the results?"
<P>"Because each persona helps build the virtual city.  But it's not a question of allowing it so much as recognizing the fact that there is no way to stop it.  We're not policemen."
<P>"As I understand it, your corporation uses the virtual city as a marketing tool, is that correct?"
<P>"Absolutely."
<P>"Then what do you tell people doing market surveys?  How do you know if someone isn't answering the same set of questions twice or three times?"
<P>"We don't.  The marketing people are very well aware that a few individuals can skew results in a very small sample.  But two things on that.  First of all, they rarely rely on a small sample.  The virtual city has a very big population, you know.  Second, the rapport between provider and clientele doesn't work that way.  It's a special relationship set up between companies and their potential customers.  They talk with each other, establish a multilogue."
<P>"I see," said the reporter.  I knew he did not.  "Well, thank you for your time Mr. Green.  Oh, one more thing."
<P>"Yes?"  Who did this guy think he was, Columbo?
<P>"Do <I>you</I> believe that your corporation should be providing virtual reality pornography?"
<P>I hesitated, holding my temper.  "I'm sorry, perhaps I have not been as clear as I should have been.  I thought I clarified the point that our corporation is <I>not</I> providing VR pornography."
<P>"But. . ."
<P>"The digital content is <I>not</I> located on our server.  Please make that clear in your coverage."
<P>"But you link to it.  Aren't you acting as a publisher in this case?"
<P>"No, absolutely not.  The only part of the virtual city simulation that we control is that content located on <I>our</I> server.  We don't tell people what to put on <I>their</I> servers."
<P>"Okay, I understand that," he said.  "But you're a conduit nonetheless, aren't you?  People can still link to it through your simulation, through your links."
<P>"Correct."
<P>"So then your corporation <I>does</I> choose what you want your viewers link to?"
<P>"Yes," I said, feeling suddenly tired.  "But that is always true, for anyone.  True for 3D or 2D environments.  True for all of the Internet."
<P>"So then, you <I>do</I> discriminate on the basis of content."
<P>"No.  We discriminate on the basis of format.  We let citizens discriminate on the basis of content."
<P>"I see," he said.  I knew he did not.  "May I ask you how you voted?"
<P>"I haven't voted yet."
