"It is evident to all alike that a great democratic revolution is going on amongst us; but all do not look at it in the same light."

<P>The life of the vCity sometimes crosses over into and affects the real world.  I'm not referring to anything like the co-mingling of reality and fantasy portrayed in Woody Allen's <B>The Purple Rose of Cairo</B>.  It just often happens that what transpires in the vCity is political, by definition.  It is a purer form of politics than we who are stuck in the real world are accustomed to witnessing.  Since it is political, it is in our minds, and because it is in our minds, it is real.  And because it is real, it makes leaders nervous.  They never really know which route the parade intends to take next, and so they must constantly look over their shoulders to figure out where to lead the march of civilization.
<P>Late in the day I'm sitting at my desk gnawing on a snack of <I>biltong</I> when the phone rings.  It's my boss, the head of the company.  Number Six in the corporation.
<P>("Who is number one?" "YOU are number six")
<P>This is very unusual; anything she has to say would normally be said over e-mail.  I swallow quickly -- which, considering that what I am eating is tougher than dried shoe leather, is a feat in itself.
<P>"What the hell is going on?" she says curtly.
<P>"In reference to what?"
<P>"I've had three calls today from reporters asking about our policy on virtual reality pornography."
<P>"Do we have one?"
<P>"Hell, I don't know," she admitted.  "Are we selling virtual reality pornography?"
<P>"No."
<P>"Then why am I getting phone calls about it?"
<P>"There's a site linked to the city simulation that does."
<P>"Is that legal?"
<P>"In the Bahamas, it is.  That's where the money goes, and that's where the site is located."
<P>"But aren't we culpable by the act of linking to it?"
<P>"No.  It's not illegal to refer to an IP address."
<P>"Still."  She mused.  "We probably shouldn't.  It could be misconstrued as advocating pornography, which we don't."
<P>"We don't really have a choice."
<P>"What?  Just remove the link!"
<P>"We can't do that.  First of all, if we do that, we admit that our corporation is refusing to transmit a reference index of digitized content based on the content itself.  It would be like pulling a 900 number from the business listings of the Yellow Pages because the business offers phone sex.  Once we do that, we open the door to being sued by anyone for almost any offense, real or imagined.  Secondly, we'd lose a lot of business, because the simulation wouldn't be simulating anything except what we think should be simulated, which isn't much of a marketing tool, is it?  And thirdly, it would be a public relations nightmare."
<P>There was a short pause.  "It's a First Amendment issue?"
<P>"Actually more of an Equal Access issue."
<P>"Christ.  So, what are you doing about it?"
<P>Now I pause.  What am <I>I</I> doing about it.  Not what should <I>we</I> be doing about it.  There is a subtlety there that cannot go unnoticed.  The Wheel turns.
