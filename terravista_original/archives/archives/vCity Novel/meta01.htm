<H3>META</H3>

<P><B>META</B> is more than a table of contents; it is a conceptual map of the novel.  <B>META</B> contains a brief description of each chapter and its relevance to the larger work.
<P>If you are looking for commentary <I>about</I> the novel, or commentary about the commentary, or additional words from the author, then what you want is <B>MIDRASH</B>.
<P>Having defined terms, I will now violate them.  Some aspects of <B>META</B>, I think, demand additional explanation (or, at least, description) bordering on commentary.  So one might argue that some <B>META</B> should actually be <B>MIDRASH</B>.  At times like this, I can only say, "Tough nuggies.  This novel isn't a democracy.  Not yet, anyway."
<P> <BR>
<P><H3>TEMPORAL CONTEXT:</H3>
<P>I wrote <B>vCity, 1.0</B> from December 1994 through August 1995.  This was a very fertile period for the development of the Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML), a process with which I was familiar but one in which I did not materially participate in any way.  Ditto on U.S. legislation attempting to restrict content on the Internet.
<P>At times during this writing period I came close to despair; it seemed that every time I finished a chapter containing some (self-defined) fantastic innovative idea or issue, I would see a headline on it the following week.  I now know what it feels like to be <I>second</I> in line at the patent office.  Anyway, my despair was largely related to the creeping feeling that by the time this novel <I>did</I> get published, my ideas would not only be considered old hat, but also a cheap rip-off.  Or, as the alien once summarized in <B>Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension</B>, "Big Deal.  So What?"  There is no greater terror for a writer than to be perceived as a hack.  With the possible exception of waking up one morning and self-perceiving hackness.
<P> <BR>
<P><H3>ABOUT THE TITLE:</H3>
<P>It's very hard to parody modern culture before it turns around and embraces you in its iron-hard marketing death grip.  I chose the <B>vCity, 1.0</B> title back in January 1995 for two reasons.  First, because English-speaking marketing departments throughout the world seem to have gone bonzo about capitalization.  Second, because nothing ever seems quite finished any more, to the point that corporations (and, regrettably, individuals and legislatures) now routinely release crap knowing that they will have to fix it later.
<P>It's <I>parody</I>, people.  P-A-R-O-D-Y.
<P>Unfortunately, I think this point will probably disappear in the mists of time, and it will not be long before publishers take to labeling editions of textbooks, cookbooks, and works of fiction with the despised N.N format.  Is this a brand marketing thang, or have we just reached a state of such an appalling lack of imagination that we cannot come up with new names for works of literature and art?
<P> <BR>
<P><H3>ABOUT THE NARRATIVE AND ITS PECULIAR HOBBY-HORSE GAIT:</H3>
<P><B>vCity, 1.0</B> is a story about a twenty-day period in the life of a virtual city simulation set in the year 2002 A.D.  But it is also the history of that simulation told from the point of view of 2002 A.D. looking backwards towards 1997, when the simulation was first brought on-line.  In sum, this novel has a lot in common with others of a similar genre including Edward Bellamy's <B>Looking Backwards, 2001 to 1887</B>, B. F. Skinner's <B>Walden II</B>, and Ernest Callenbach's <B>Ecotopia</B>.  Namely, the reader might not know what the heck is going on.
<P>Ostensibly, the story is about a crisis that erupts when someone places virtual reality pornography in the vCity.  In fact, this is a book about <I>why</I> vCities should exist, not merely <I>how</I>.
<P>So in the course of writing this novel, I found myself trying to swim a race and pull my trunks on at the same time.  Of course it's fun to stick to merely a straight narrative, and dog-paddle through two hours of mindless entertainment.  But I felt (perhaps wrongly) that I could not merely throw the reader into the middle of the pool ala Stephenson's <B>Snowcrash</B>.  Instead, I decided to mix the narrative with more thematic chapters describing how the vCity worked and why it looked the way it did.
<P>You may not like the results: the novel does have a narrative flow, but it is stop-and-go, a bit like driving in rush-hour traffic.
<P>It may be that years from now, readers coming back to <B>vCity, 1.0</B> will marvel at its stupidity, explaining such things as  PC mode, HMDs, downloads, kiosks, scapps, and steamrolls.  All I can say is: forgive him.  The man who wrote this novel was trapped in the amber of his timeline.
<P> <BR>
<P><H3>A STRICTLY NARRATIVE APPROACH?</H3>
<P>In the old days, "pacing" was almighty, writing was sequential, peeking ahead to the end "ruined" the novel, and in general, you went where the author wanted you to go and that was that, because basically authorship was dictatorship.  But now, after the Glorious Revolution, things are more democratic.  Just because I wrote this novel in order doesn't mean you have to read it that way.
<P>So if you want to follow the main narrative and skip the rest, like a bloodhound with its nose to the ground sniffing out a trail, then you would do best to read the following chapters in this order: 2, 4, 7, 11, 15, 17-20, 24, 26-33.
<P>Then go back and read the other chapters at your leisure.  Or do whatever you want, actually.  But remember: with freedom to choose, comes responsibility to choose wisely.  When you learn that lesson, you become an adult.

<A HREF = "dedi.htm"><H3>DEDICATION</H3></A>
<P>
<A HREF = "c01s01.htm"><H3>CHAPTER ONE:</H3></A>
<P>In which the reader is presented with cracker barrel philosophy regarding the technological metaphor of the Kaleidoscope and its relevance to modern culture.
<P>
<A HREF = "c02s01.htm"><H3>CHAPTER TWO:</H3></A>
<P>Introducing First Citizen (Dr. E. Forest Green) as the narrator of this story.
<P>Forest, during a late night inspection tour of the Confluencia sector, is wandering through the halls of Justin Thyme's entertainment suite, <I>Sage Advice</I>.  Forest notices a door labeled <I>Exon Inspiration</I> and discovers to his dismay that it is a virtual reality pornographic world created by Lee Ward.
<P>Forest doesn't like what he sees, which is tough shit; however, upon closer inspection he discovers a minor violation of the vCity simulation guidelines, and uses this as an excuse to call a general referendum of the vCitizens with an eye towards <I>banning</I> the offending site.
<P>
<A HREF = "c03s01.htm"><H3>CHAPTER THREE:</H3></A>
<P>Introducing some vCity concepts including the <I>ecosimm</I> and the <I>scapp</I>.  There is a <A HREF = "terms01.htm">Glossary of Terms</A> elsewhere in this novel.
<P>How will a vCity grow?  This chapter suggests that there may be great wisdom in laissez faire, and introduces an important rule of vCity life: to expect the unexpected.  The theme resurfaces in several later chapters.
<P>"The desert in eternal dawn" is, of course, an important metaphor for modern capitalism and modern culture.  You figure it out.
<P>
<A HREF = "c04s01.htm"><H3>CHAPTER FOUR:</H3></A>
<P>Lee Ward and First Citizen engage in a brief exchange of e-mail messages, framing the nature of the debate.  Lee Ward defends freedom of expression and choice.  Art is art, s/he writes, and people must decide for themselves what constitutes good and evil.  First Citizen argues in favor of moral and social responsibility.  Art is not art when it becomes exploitation for profit, he counters; and even if all morality is relative, that does not relieve individuals from their responsibility to oppose evil wherever it appears and in whatever form it arises.
<P>
<A HREF = "c05s01.htm"><H3>CHAPTER FIVE:</H3></A>
<P>Introducing a boatload of important VR and Internet-related concepts including <I>beaming</I>, "casbar", vKiosks, nowlinks, downloads, and <I>mapps</I>.
<P>Also introducing Rainforest Mac, a shadowy vCitizen whose writing appears in chapter 20 and who herself appears in chapter 31, and the Mole rats, whose leader, the Mole Queen, is described briefly in chapter 12 and actually appears in chapter 32.
<P>This is the first chapter to spell out the <I>why</I> of the vCity.  The vCity was created as a marketing tool for the purpose of simulation.  There is more than a semantic distinction between marketing and advertising; between simulation and entertainment.  This tiresome theme rears its ugly head many more times during the novel, most notably in chapter 22, which is basically a thumbnail sketch of vCity development philosophy.
<P>
<A HREF = "c06s01.htm"><H3>CHAPTER SIX:</H3></A>
<P>In which First Citizen discusses some of the strengths and limitations of the vCity as a simulation tool, and why to expect the unexpected.  There is also a little fugue in this chapter about a previous referendum process on "very off-track betting."
<P>The vCity Sports & Entertainment Complex was set up to encourage conceptual experimentation, as in the case of Lightspeed, an entirely fabricated sport introduced by a sporting goods corporation in hopes of stimulating sales of equipment.  Or designing interactive game-simulations based on real world sports.
<P>This produced an unexpected effect.  In some cases, "The Simulation, as it turned out, was more interesting, fast-paced, affordable and accessible than the real sport itself."
<P>But there is another rule of vCity development: "You can't make people simm."  After spending much time and effort simulating a mass transit system, the vCity designers discovered that no one much cared.  "It's hard to gauge the efficacy of a transportation concept in a virtual world where people can <I>beam</I> anywhere they like, anytime...."  This theme remerges in chapters 10 and 25, where the narrator describes the equally futile attempt to design a road and highway simulation.
<P>
<A HREF = "c07s01.htm"><H3>CHAPTER SEVEN:</H3></A>
<P>Introducing E. Forest Green in the real world, where he has to deal with his boss (who reappears in chapter 27), a woman more accustomed to the efficiency of a hierarchical command structure than the mind-numbing boggle of democratic anarchy.
<P>An important point not to be dismissed lightly is the notion that corporations will hold vCity referendums in order to satisfy legal criteria, not merely because it is the right thing to do.
<P>
<A HREF = "c08s01.htm"><H3>CHAPTER EIGHT:</H3></A>
<P>Introducing some members of E. Forest Green's family including his wife Eliza, who reappears in chapters 10, 19, 23, 27, 29, and 32.  The Greens spend a quiet evening at home / on the VR beach at their Buena Vistas "estate".  The narrator describes some of the problems of "zoning" a vCity and the difficulties of trying to impose order upon an unruly electronic citizenry.  Introducing the concept of signposting and (although not mentioned here by name) steamrolling further explained in chapter 19.
<P>There is also a nice little fugue here about the politics of substitution and neo-Ludditism, featuring a cameo appearance by E. Forest Green's father (whose paternal advice briefly reappears in chapter 19).
<P>
<A HREF = "c09s01.htm"><H3>CHAPTER NINE:</H3></A>
<P>In which the narrator describes the concept of the virtual university, which in this case is called the vCity Internet University.  "Sometimes," he writes, "existence in the vCity is not about the future, it becomes the future."
<P>The latter half of this chapter is a kind of running dialogue between E. Forest Green and an old professor friend, Dean "Pete", from Bejamin Thompson University.  The Dean worries that not everyone will be able to benefit from the new education order arising from the existence of virtual universities on the Internet.
<P>"What gives you the idea," replies Forrest, "that access to education was universal under the old system?"
<P>
<A HREF = "c10s01.htm"><H3>CHAPTER TEN:</H3></A>
<P>In which the narrator explains how telecommuting turned out to be an evolutionary rather than revolutionary development, and why telepresence ("nolo" or "no local operator" controlled machinery) turned out to be a mixed blessing.  The Expect the Unexpected theme first expressed in chapter 3, here as it applies to economics and politics.
<P>Also introducing Londolozi the Cat, a seminal figure not just in this novel, but in future novels as well, although he may not necessarily be recognized as Londo but rather as the same cat with a different name.  Londolozi serves a necessary Jungian / Schroedinger altered states function.  Additionally, it is a convention of Western mythology and fables in general that protagonists can be recognized as Good people by the fact that animals will talk to them.  This happens in chapter 14.
<P>
<A HREF = "c11s01.htm"><H3>CHAPTER ELEVEN:</H3></A>
<P>Returning to the narrative, just in case readers have wandered off to the refrigerator for a snack.  First reference to the <I>diablito</I> concept.
<P>
<A HREF = "c12s01.htm"><H3>CHAPTER TWELVE:</H3></A>
<P>Not only a <I>how</I> of the vCity, but also a <I>why</I> a vCity chapter.
<P>A narrative of what first-time visitors to the vCity might see and do (ironically, not all that different from the virtual worlds actually on the net as of December 1995) to become vCitizens.  There's a lot of good stuff in this chapter including an explanation of the techsimm vCity International Airport and of the No Foundation Domicile concept.
<P>Also, brief fugues about electronic commerce, the New Millenites, and children on the net, symbolized by the Mole Queen.
<P>
<A HREF = "c13s01.htm"><H3>CHAPTER THIRTEEN:</H3></A>
<P>In which E. Forest Green, in flashback mode, describes how the vCity came to be in a corporate setting.
<P>This is a pretty busy chapter from a conceptual point of view: there is a good deal of rumination about "convergence" of telecommunications, computing, and other industries; also, a boatload of material about why and how people choose technological systems.
<P>The point, of course, (for those who still don't get it after 100 pages of material) is that the vCity is a tool to help us transition into the future in which we wish to live.  This theme appears all over the novel, but is best explained in chapter 22.
<P>
<A HREF = "c14s01.htm"><H3>CHAPTER FOURTEEN:</H3></A>
<P>What is wealth?  Only a human would ask such a stupid question.
<P>There is a reprise of this theme at the end of chapter 20, at which point the reader will understand why this chapter exists.
<P>
<A HREF = "c15s01.htm"><H3>CHAPTER FIFTEEN:</H3></A>
<P>Okay, hold on to the seat belt, this is where the ride becomes <I>fun</I>.
<P>A very fast-paced chapter with lots of conversation, the kind one might expect from a modern novel.  The excrement has hit the rotory blades, people are now aware that Lee Ward's <I>Exon Inspiration</I> has been placed in the vCity, and all hell is breaking loose.
<P>The stage is now set for the clash of forces roughly defined by the individuals who call.  On the one extreme are the forces of unbridled capitalism represented by Roberto Canseco; on the other end of the spectrum lay the forces of unbridled puritanism represented by Christine Wallach.  Closely allied with the latter, but more principally concerned with the letter of the law, is the U.S. government represented by John Warden of the NTS.  His opposite, of course, is David Smythe-Johnson, Vice-President for the Office of General Counsel of The Corporation.  Finally, for good measure, are the forces of clueless media -- the randomly shifting cargo of democracy, as it were, capable of accidentally rolling over and crushing any innocent in its path.
<P>
<A HREF = "c16s01.htm"><H3>CHAPTER SIXTEEN:</H3></A>
<P>In which First Citizen describes Downtown, Shantytown, and other aspects of vCity life.  A very longish portion of this chapter is devoted to the idea of vBicycling, which probably already exists, but if not, will soon.  The concept already sort of exists in the sense that people watch videos while exercycling (or Nordic tracking); vBicycling is an obvious extrapolation of that.
<P>
<A HREF = "c17s01.htm"><H3>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN:</H3></A>
<P>How will the referendum process be established and work?  This chapter suggests one possible explanation.  Also, more about zoning and why Zoning Councils may be necessary for the good of the many.
<P>There is also a really neat idea here for a virtual stock market, which would be a very interesting proposition although probably considered illegal in many parts of the world.
<P>
<A HREF = "c18s01.htm"><H3>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN:</H3></A>
<P>Pay attention to the deTocqueville (and Sennett) headers, dammit!  Why do you think I put them there, to amuse myself?
<P>E. Forest Green enjoys a quiet morning out on the veranda with a newspaper.  The old-fashioned smudgy kind.
<P>
<A HREF = "c19s01.htm"><H3>CHAPTER NINETEEN:</H3></A>
<P>E. Forest Green puts on his thinking cap and figures out what is going on, more or less.  He reasons out that the <I>Exon Inspiration</I> is nothing more or less than adult content for the adult market.  The U.S. government's interest is strictly pragmatic; it does not want entertainment dollars flowing to offshore sites.
<P>
<A HREF = "c20s01.htm"><H3>CHAPTER TWENTY:</H3></A>
<P>Introducing the idea of <I>vBrahmans</I>.
<P>In many ways this chapter is the flip-side of C17 (or perhaps the other half of the matching tie-and-handkerchief set, use whichever metaphor you prefer).  There is no guarantee, of course, that the vCity will function as intended.  On the other hand, there is no reason to assume that it will be entirely dysfunctional either.  The moral of the story is that if something is important to you, you hang in there and you fight back with everything you've got, mostly because the alternative stinks.
<P>
<A HREF = "c21s01.htm"><H3>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE:</H3></A>
<P>A brief flashback looking at some of the legal problems encountered on the Internet when posting content -- an old chesnut updated for VR issues.
<P>
<A HREF = "c22s01.htm"><H3>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO:</H3></A>
<P>E. Forest Green explains why the Corporation decided to create the vCity (C13 somewhat describes the how).
<P>In the larger schema of the novel, this chapter is the fulcrum.  Why you should care about a story about utopia (or, in this case, vTopia)?  Because what is technologically possible and what is socially desirable are two different things, and if you abandon the political responsibility to decide upon the latter, than you will surely end up being crushed by the juggernaut of the former.
<P>
<A HREF = "c23s01.htm"><H3>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE:</H3></A>
<P>First Citizen describes a VR wedding.  Of all the chapters in the novel, this is probably the least preachy -- a straight, old-fashioned dose of sci-fi silliness.  It's served up as a counterpoint to the weighty theme of the previous chapter.  The payoff comes quickly, incidentally, so it's actually possible to read C23 and C24 as a set and feel satisfied that this novel is, indeed, Art and not merely cheap VRxploitation.
<P>
<A HREF = "c24s01.htm"><H3>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR:</H3></A>
<P>E. Forest Green postulates: "We move around, we interact, we live our lives here on Earth producing and consuming, creating and destroying, attending weddings and births and funerals.  Perhaps all of this is merely a very elaborate illusion, however."
<P>Who are we?  <I>What</I> are we?  And if all of life is illusory, than why do anything at all?  Read this chapter and ponder the eternal question: does a character in a novel have free will?  Do we?
<P>
<A HREF = "c25s01.htm"><H3>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE:</H3></A>
<P>Introducing the Sandbox Paradigm.
<P>Will the vCity be perfect?  No, of course not.  No city is, no human endeavor can be, therefore even the vCity will have traffic jams.  Watch out for those RoboWipers!
<P>
<A HREF = "c26s01.htm"><H3>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX:</H3></A>
<P>Which finishes the explanation of the Sandbox Paradigm revealed at the end of C25.
<P>This chapter is a quick slap in the face for anyone who might have missed where First Citizen stands on the issue of the <I>Exon Inspiration</I>.  Several earlier chapters stressed the point that inspecting <I>format</I>, not <I>content</I>, is the chief duty of members of the Zoning Council.  So don't blame the author if you slept through that lecture.
<P>
<A HREF = "c27s01.htm"><H3>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN:</H3></A>
<P>Like C15, another fun chapter written in the modern style of fast paced action and loopy cliches (sigh, <I>another</I> corporate boardroom?  Can't we have business meetings in a mosh pit once in a while?).  E. Forest meets The Man and explains how The Corporation can extricate itself from its present political difficulties.  Surprisingly, it all makes sense.  In return, Dr. Green finds himself shoehorned out of his job.  Holy Plot Twist, Batman!
<P>There's a set-up here that is revealed in C29, but you have to pay attention or you'll miss it.  On the other hand, if you do, then no harm done, because you won't have to wait long to find out what it is.
<P>
<A HREF = "c28s01.htm"><H3>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT:</H3></A>
<P>The moment we've all been waiting for.  The <I>Exon Inspiration</I> is <I>banned</I>, and First Citizen tells Lee Ward to "Go, and Simm No More."
<P>
<A HREF = "c29s01.htm"><H3>CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE:</H3></A>
<P>In which E. Forest Green's life changes radically and for the better.  The point is that sometimes one can get a little too caught up in the fantasy that is reality, and thus lose the meaning of the larger mystery.  Whether virtual reality pornography exists or not is rather irrelevant when compared to something really important, wouldn't you agree?
<P>
<A HREF = "c30s01.htm"><H3>CHAPTER THIRTY:</H3></A>
<P>This novel is merely the first of a series.  It is, in fact, only one small piece of the larger puzzle.  Using the <I>Go</I> analogy, this novel is only one part of the board.  You just haven't seen it yet.  Wheels within wheels.
<P>
<A HREF = "c31s01.htm"><H3>CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE:</H3></A>
<P>E. Forest Green meets with Yolanda MacKenzie (Rainforest Mac) to discuss how the stones lay on the board.  A nice fugue here about the city of Washington, D.C. which -- most people have probably forgotten -- was also a vCity of its day.
<P>There's a lot of apocalyptic mysticism here.  Some might even call it nonsense.  My advice to you is not to worry about it right now.  It's meaning will become evident over time.  By then you'll be older, wiser, and fatter.
<P>
<A HREF = "c32s01.htm"><H3>CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO:</H3></A>
<P>In which E. Forest Green meets the Mole Queen for the first time.
<P>It is a convention of western literature that the protagonist find <I>someone</I> to whom he can hand off the mantle of responsibility.  He is then free to die or, as in this case, to live.
<P>
<A HREF = "c33s01.htm"><H3>CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE:</H3></A>
<P>In this, the final chapter of vCity 1.0, the story begins as it ends.  The point is not that Dr. Green will take the new job -- he said he would think about it, and the general sense of C32 is that he intends to pursue other things -- but that life goes on.  If not a crisis here, then a new one somewhere else.
