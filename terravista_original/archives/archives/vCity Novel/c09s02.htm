<P>At the dawn of the 21st century, the modern university was indistinguishable from any other corporate entity.  It owned a variety of assets including real estate and facilities; engaged in basic and applied research in many different areas; employed, insured, and provided health care benefits for thousands of people; prepared (and overran) annual budgets; provided a plethora of services in return for money; and generally competed against members of its own kind in the marketplace for revenue and profit.  Many universities had their own security forces, their own computer networks, and their own form of currency.  Universities formed associations, paid lobbyists, and obtained fat government grants and contracts.  In sum, they were players in the global marketplace.
<P>However, what a university actually <I>achieved</I> was a little vague; every now and then you would see a real world university struggling to decide if it had a fundamental purpose other than self-preservation.  But then again, the same could be said of many transnational conglomerates that asked from time to time: "what business are we in?"
<P>The general assumption was that a university was in the business of educating people, advancing knowledge, and possibly both simultaneously.  It was a strange industry in the sense that people could actually educate themselves and advance knowledge without need of an elaborate infrastructure.  Nevertheless society seemed to prefer individuals who glistened with the lustre of having associated with an institution.  There was a lot of brand name loyalty in that market.  A university could charge stiff tuition fees -- sometimes three times that of its competitors, for essentially the same product -- simply because it had a reputation for excellence or prestige (or both).
<P>Unfortunately for universities, free-lance professorship and self-education made a comeback via the Web.  Some of the smarter real world universities anticipated an erosion of their revenue base and tried to re-invent themselves.  But the really ugly surprise even for these enlightened administrators was the discovery that a university was not a place, but a concept, which anyone could create overnight.
