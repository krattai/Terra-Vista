<P>There is no such thing as a typical tourist.  In the most general terms, it is a human being over the age of four who has a PC, an Internet connection, and web-browsing software.  That pretty much defines about one billion people today.  The rest of the world, even in the year 2002, just isn't linked yet, either because they have a lousy telecomm infrastructure, or because they can't afford the toys, or because they suffer under the humiliation of living in a People's Democracy somewhere.
<P>Of those one billion people, about 90% have what we call "skinny pipes," anathema to the internetworking industry because it makes the most vibrant, fantastic new digitized products and services about as exciting as watching milk curdle.  A "skinny pipe" is an Internet connection over a copper telephone wire transmitting and receiving data at 28.8K bits per second.  It is pretty good at basic things like downloading text files and e-mail.  It pretty much sucks at anything else.  Well, maybe I am being harsh.  I can remember a time when I thought that 2.4K bits per second was a startling technological advance.  And we do have some amazingly efficient software packages (our own corporation sells the <I>Major Crunch!</I> product for only $14.99 plus applicable sales tax) that could compress an elephant down to the size of a mouse.  But the bottom line remains that if you need to send someone a Meg (1,000K bytes) of content, it's still going to take a minute.  And if you're trying to megaburp (send 1,000K bytes per second), that's a problem.
<P>Anyway, what this boils down to is that our potential effective customer base is about 100 million people worldwide.  These are people who can "speak" the electronic/ photonic language of the VR world; who can view and interact in a vCity with ease.  VRML-based browsers can support the other 900 million, but people want immediate gratification, they don't want to die of old age staring at their PC displays waiting for megaburps.
<P>So on any given day, we have about one million new tourists attempting to access our SLIP/PPP Internet address.  I can't swear that everyone gets through on the first try.  Think of it as getting 50,000 phone calls an hour.  Through some pretty neat network management that I won't go into here for obvious reasons, the system senses an overflow and routes these calls to different "mirror" sites.  This is why the vCity never crashes -- because the original clones itself in 14 different servers worldwide every 4.3 seconds.
