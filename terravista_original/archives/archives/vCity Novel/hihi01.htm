<H4>Overview:</H4>
<P>
We always wondered why the aerospace transportation business was run by a bunch of engineers when it was obvious that what it really needed was a bunch of truckers.  It always also puzzled us that space stations were designed by engineers rather than architectural firms, but never mind that.  One puzzle at a time.
<P>
<B>Haul It High, Inc.</B> is in the business of bringing payload to orbit, but more importantly, providing a capability to bring it back down too, or fix it while it is up there, or deconstruct it, or refurbish it.  <B>HIH, Inc.</B> provides attractive insurance, financing, and customer support packages.  In short, it is a complete space transportation service provider.  And it is run by <A HREF="http://www.well.com/user/adamgru/vCity/tales/lamberj1.htm">Jack "Jocko" Lamberghetti</A>, a tough-as-nails no-nonsense ass-kicking CEO who cut his teeth in the trucking, shipping, and air cargo business.
<P>
Despite its recent corporate advertising slogan, <B>HIH, Inc.</B> does not, in fact, provide <I>any</I> payload to any orbit.  The chief "workhorse" of the <I>Blue Planet</I> [vTmk] fleet is the 2-crewperson refurbishable <I>Rock & Roll</I> [vTmk] spacecraft built by <B>AerospaceSmiths, Inc.</B> with a limited cross-range L/D ratio and a measly 2x3 meter cargo bay.  Launched piggyback on a carrier aircraft and detached at an altitude of 23 kilometers, the <I>Rock & Roll</I> spacecraft flares nose up and uses rocket thrust to escape velocity at approximate latitude 22 degrees N to an altitude of no more than 160 kilometers.  Depending upon staytime and in-flight burns designed to move to different inclinations, a flight can deliver anywhere from 1 to 3 metric tons (about 2,205 to 6,615 pounds) to a low-Earth orbit.
<P>
At an average of US$12,000,000 a flight, that amounts to US$4000-$US12000/kilogram (about US$1800-US$5400/pound) -- not exactly cheap.  On the other hand, having trained crewpeople in orbit to handle unanticipated problems leads to a launch success rate of 98%, best in the business.  The <I>Blue Planet</I> [vTmk] service <I>guarantees</I> full compensation with very affordable insurance.  In an industry where launches are no guarantees and where payloads are getting <I>very</I> expensive to design and build, it is no wonder that <B>HIH</B> keeps a full manifest of almost one launch a day.
<P>
In fact, <B>HIH</B> doesn't make much money providing "haulage" despite its name.  In truth, the corporation works more like a "Mr. Fix-It" in space.  Kind of like the guy you call when you need to change a burned-out light bulb at the bottom of the swimming pool.  This is a very easy thing to do <I>if</I> you have the know-how and the equipment.
<P>
Finally, the main cost of space transportation, as it turns out, has very little to do with the gleaming spacecraft and everything to do with more down-to-Earth tasks of making sure that cargo is shipped in good condition to the em/debarkation bays and loaded/unloaded correctly, as well as other mundane tasks such as safety inspection, daily maintenance, etcetera.  Customers need to be notified if problems are going to arise and they need to be reasonably satisfied that it isn't going to cost them anything.  In short, the profit charts look very much the same as they do in the ocean shipping and trucking businesses.
<H4>Growth Potential?</H4>
<P>
Good.  We like <B>HIH Inc.</B> for their blend of market saavy and near-monopoly.  They are not the only space launch business in town but they do seem to know how to manage a fleet and a manifest.  The only real problem we see with this business is that there is a limit to how many payloads people <I>need</I> to place and operate in low-Earth orbit.  As long as telecomm demands remain strong -- and admittedly, there's no slacking off in sight -- then <B>HIH, Inc.</B> will be a market leader.  Any kind of extraordinary space programme to build a lunar or Ares colony, or deep-space flotilla, would also boost business.  No pun intended.
