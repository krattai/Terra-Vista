<H4>Overview:</H4>
<P>
The <B>Smart Lanes Corporation</B> produces specialized road surfaces and materials and "other wheeled-vehicle infrastructure media," according to its latest Annual Report.  Nobody actually knows what "infrastructure media" means, but it sounds high-tech, and therefore is a good in and of itself.  Analysts suspect that it refers to the 21st century habit of wiring telecomm lines into construction materials that formerly were just big dumb slabs of something, but are now considered "smart" because they can transmit data back to a data warehouse.
<P>
Road technology, from 6000 BCE to the modern era, hasn't really changed that much.  That sounds like a ridiculous statement on face value, but consider how many road systems have been self-diagnosing and self-repairing and then you see the point.
<P>
Anyway, <B>SLC</B> pioneered in the manufacture of <B>Smart Surface</B> [vP] technology.  Typically this is material that is designed for a MTBR (Mean Time Between Replacement) of about 20 years.  It is primarily composed of a hydrocarbon/ceramic composite mixed in with plain old sand, quartz, and other trace elements and minerals, all overlaying an inductive copper wire grid and thin-film etched microchips.  The material is designed not only to expand or contract according to external temperature variations but also to react electromechanically to internal stimuli as well.  If a surface crack develops, for example, it is possible for a piece of <B>Smart Surface</B> to realign its structure to fill in the gap.  There is a limit to how far this can go, at at some point a <B>Smart Surface</B> module just sort of gives up the ghost and becomes a hopelessly tangled and inelastic blob.  The stuff really isn't repairable, it simply needs replacing.
<P>
Later modifications to <B>Smart Surface</B> enabled a thin surface layer to "wrinkle" according to external conditions of ice or water, to "stiffen" under especially heavy loads, or to "soften" to permit channeled run-off or minor variations in subsurface conditions (such as settling or hard freezes).
<P>
The latest <B>SLC</B> innovation, its <I>Commcrete</I> Brand [vTmk] product, enables system operators to receive and transmit data to road surfaces.  This enables modules to tell other modules statements like "Hey, a <I>really</I> heavy object just pushed me at a velocity of 91 kph -- better stiffen yourself in 0.7 seconds" or "I think I just felt a raindrop -- anybody else around here getting wet?  Should we wrinkle?"  This is all effected by some pretty nifty firmware deployed at the modular level, because designers quickly discovered that it took too long to get data from a road to a CPU and back again in time to do anything meaningful.
<P>
Needless to say, <I>Commcrete</I> Brand [vTmk] is <I>very</I> expensive material to make and deploy.  Its chief use is for very specialized applications such as airport runways, bridges, tunnels, and loading docks.  Plain old <B>Smart Surface</B> technology is used for the vCity <I>megabahns</I>, and the rest of the vCity transportation system uses the even older 20th century "dumb" technologies such as reinforced concrete & asphalt.
<P>
<H4>Growth Potential?</H4>
<P>
Excellent.  The <I>Commcrete</I> Brand [vTmk] is a recognized brand name and <B>SLC</B>'s vPatent on <B>Smart Surface</B> technology insures that the corporation will be able to maintain its market advantage against rivals.  The major obstacle to full deployment of their products is expense, which may come down over time.  Nevertheless it is clear that more primitive technologies will always be more cost-effective for many applications.  <B>SLC</B> has shrewdly established a non-profit subsidiary, the <B>Center for Study of Reduction of Traffic-Related Deaths</B> which routinely recommends the use of smart surfaces, among other findings.  <B>SLC</B> is also investigating ways of making longer and longer stretches of road function as a kind of telecomm network which, during periods of little or no traffic, can be used as an auxiliary comm system for the <B>vCity Transportation Information Center</B>.
