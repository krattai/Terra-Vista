<P>	Since I'm scrolling around out in the desert, I might as well point to a local example.  The LiC corporation has a production plant out here somewhere.  It's not easy to find the damn thing because it was designed to blend into the local environment.  If I remember correctly, it looked something like an old style Spanish mission.
<P>	After wandering around on the topside for a while, I find it.  I could have <I>beamed</I> there via a bookmark, but that's not as much fun.  Besides, by <I>beaming</I> one does not discover new additions to the landscape.
<P>	The architect that designed the VR structure used mostly materials that she assumed would be native to the local ecology: brick, stone, and mud.  (Clicking on the signpost gives the reader a complete text explanation of why the building was designed that way.  There is a lot of aesthetic mumbo-jumbo involving explanations of texture and allusions to the history of Americans native to the desert southwest, but she seems to have omitted another point, namely that using local materials is cheaper up front and over time owing to costs of transportation to the plant site)  The LiC building is also designed to be self-sustaining.  It recycles much of its own water, and generates most of its own power via solar dynamic reflectors.  (More clicking on each of these items brings up more explanation, this time more technical).
<P>	The production plant itself is underground (to help with heat distribution and cooling, according to the text explanations).  The plant, which is almost entirely a robotic facility with a human staff of three people, produces a lithium-carbon composite called aromatic lithocarbons.
<P>	(Oh God, more technical mumbo-jumbo.  An entire Ph.D. thesis, it looks like.  Um . . . apparently this stuff is not stable in pure form, and tends to turn to jelly or something unless supported by an internal carbon-silicate lattice with trace elements of heavier metals.  Quite frankly, I don't understand what this author is talking about.  But then again, I don't know how my toaster works, either.)
<P>	Now, the interesting part about the LiC is that none of this exists in reality.  Neither the building nor any of its technology, nor the management.  All of it is DDT&E.  Or to be precise, it is pre-DDT&E, designed to entice investors and draw both supporters and detractors out into the open where the parent company (Registry Protected) can engage them in multilogue.
<P>	Which is, in fact, exactly what happened.  According to my follow-up research with designers at the real world corporation, the response they received was very favorable.  Lithium-Carbon composites are potentially useful because they have the strength and tensile cohesion of steel, but they are much lighter than steel.  Lighter, in fact, than aluminum.  The "LiC" mailbox was apparently stuffed with inquiries from real-world designers in the automobile, aerospace, and construction industries, all demanding to know where they could obtain supplies of this composite.  The mailbox was also filled with scientific bombast and barrages from university professors, researchers, et al, who delighted in pointing out flaws in the chemistry theory.  And there were missives as well from robotics companies, architectural firms, and management consultancies, all demanding a piece of the action.
<P>	The real world corporation that created "LiC" was, naturally, delighted.  Well, not 100% delighted.  Apparently they also received a couple of patent infringement lawsuits.  I'm told that their attorneys are not squeamish, however.  Anyway even negatives can be positives.  At least they flushed their opposition out into the open before going any further.
