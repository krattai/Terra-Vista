<P>Some vCitizens, individuals and representatives from real world corporations, decided to design VR sites to showcase their ideas for other kinds of power generators and power plants.  Although none of these sites were <I>banned</I>, we had several hellacious disputes over the few referendums that did come up.
<P>Several people, including one real world corporation in California that designs buses and trucks, proposed using fuel cells.  Fuel cells aren't rocket science, although they were used in early spacecraft technology.  Very simple concept to generate electricity from hydrogen and oxygen using the fact that the former yearns to give up an electron to the latter.  A few electrodes and you're in business.  Advocates bally-hooed this technology because it is non-polluting and has an endless supply of fuel (water).
<P>I, and others, pointed out the flaws in the concept.  First of all, you're going to need a whole lotta oxygen and hydrogen to do this, we told them.  Storing this is a pain in the buttinski.  You can solve your volume problem by using liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen (LOX).  Unfortunately, liquid hydrogen and LOX aren't just found lying around in pools.  Someone has to make the stuff and bottle it and transport it.  Secondly, making hydrogen and oxygen from water, not to mention cooling them down to liquid, will require <I>lots</I> of electricity.  Oops.
<P>Still, in the overall environmental sense this Rube Goldbergian system of relying on fuel cells was a lot less ridiculous than the existing petrochemical industry, so the sites stayed.
