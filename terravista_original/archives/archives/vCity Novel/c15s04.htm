<P>The next phone call was from Roberto Canseco.  For those of you who have been living under a rock for the past ten years, Canseco is a publishing mogul and one of the wealthiest men in the world.  He owns, quite probably, a piece of everything: banks; real estate; stocks; companies; legislative representatives in fifty-seven different democracies.  This man, a Columbian-born U.S. citizen, is a very nice guy.  Provided you are a business associate and not a competitor.
<P>"Doctor Green?  I would talk with you for a moment please."
<P>"It would be an honor, sir.  I so rarely get a chance to talk with one of our stockholders."  This, of course, was an insane lie -- the odds are even that anyone I talk to on the phone does own stock in our corporation, even if he or she doesn't know it.
<P>"Doctor, I have received information that the U.S. <I>federales</I> will be signing a 59B against you."
<P>"Your informants are quite efficient," I said pleasantly, inwardly shocked.  "I just got off the phone not too long ago with John Warden of the Telecommunications Standards Division of the NSA."
<P>"That man is the devil's spawn."
<P>"I wouldn't know."
<P>"His nose grows large from sniffing into other people's business."
<P>"I've never met him."
<P>"I have.  He is a little man.  Little men are dangerous."
<P>I had to stifle a laugh, because of the pictures I have seen, Canseco himself is a short, stout man a head shorter than most.
<P>"Yes, little minds are dangerous too, because there are so many of them," Canseco continued.  "This is the reason I call you today.  You should not shut down the site of the Australian woman."
<P>"Australian woman?"  I repeated needlessly.  This guy must spend a fortune in spies.
<P>"The woman, yes," he explained patiently, as if dealing with someone who was hearing impaired.  "The one who designed the Internet pictures."
<P>"Oh, I see," I said, stalling for time.  What was the connection here?  Why would Canseco call me himself instead of having one of his attorneys do it?  What was his personal interest in this matter?  Or was it business?  "Well, don't worry, sir, we don't shut down anybody."
<P>"You will not pull the link from your city simulation."  It was phrased in the form of a question, but somehow it didn't come out that way.
<P>I decided to go over to the offensive.  "Are you <I>asking</I> us, or <I>telling</I> us?"
<P>He chortled.  "Asking, of course.  Hey, you've got <I>huevos</I>, I like that."
<P>"Well, I hope to keep them.  So as long as your asking, let me ask you a question.  What's your interest in this?"
<P>"Eh, eh, eh, don't let your nose grow too long."
<P>"Sorry."
<P>There was a pause.  "You're a bright boy, you put on your thinking cap and figure it out.  Meanwhile you tell Smith-Jones or whatever the hell his name is to call me if you get troubles."  He was referring to David Michael Smythe-Johnson, the head of our Office of General Counsel.
<P>"I'll be happy to mention your support to him."
<P>"Good, good.  You keep up the good work, then.  <I>Adios</I>."
<P>"<I>Gracias</I> for calling," I said, but the line was already disconnected.
