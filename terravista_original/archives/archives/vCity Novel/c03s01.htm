"City planning by specialists is a recent event in the history of cities."

<P>	The desert always helps me relax.  It is not, as many people often visualize it, an empty wasteland.  It is an ecosystem in its own right, fragile because of the relative lack of rainfall, utterly serene and beautiful in the warm orange and pink glow of a permanent dawn.
<P>	It was one of the first sectors we created because of its stark vastness.  When you don't pay too close attention to the details -- individual scrub bushes, cloud and bird scapps, that kind of thing -- the outback works better than most other sectors.  Our karoo stretches from the Volcano Slopes in the West to the wind-swept dunes and beaches in the East.  The desert is the southern border of the vCity outlands, beyond which there is only the Great Beyond.
<P>	Its pale blue sky does not stretch to azure infinity.  In addition to being an overworked literary cliché, that would be a mathematical impossibility.
<P>	The original desert was pretty lame as a simulation.  The basic problem was that none of us knew anything about the ecosystem we were trying to simulate.  The solution was obvious, and that was to hire some experts.  The corporation donated large tracts of zoning volume to the Center for Preservation and Study of Desert Ecologies, Inc..  In return for giving them sector space to run their own simulations, the CPSDE helped our VR designers integrate variables of climate and the growth of flora and fauna.
<P>	This proved to be such a useful technique that we subsequently duplicated it for the tundra, the mountains, the piedmont, the "badlands", the rainforest/jungle, the savannah/prairie, the marshlands/swamplands, The Bay, and The Ocean.  Strangely enough the most useful of all the experts came from the oil & gas corporations, but that's a story best left untold at the moment.
<P>	That was a good example of how the early vCity grew itself.  It turned out that there were a great many professionals out on the Web with a lot of pent-up energy to do VR modeling and simulation of things that interested them.  Stifled at their own jobs, or perhaps frustrated with the slow pace of the real world, they sought outlet through the vCity, where virtual estate was free and ideas on form and substance could literally take shape as they pleased.  All our corporation asked was that they "be nice."
<P>	The response was astonishing.  Not only were the early "freesteaders" nice, but also they were helpful, offering advice & aid on a variety of issues that we hadn't originally considered.  In effect, our corporation received a ton of free consultation for which, had we tried to hire experts, we would have had to pay a fistful of money.
<P>	After a while, a few corporations began to ask to set up alter-ego simmcorps (simulated corporations) in the vCity.  We told them to go ahead provided that they adhered to the zoning guidelines established for each sector.  Our thought was that we needed as much help as possible to flesh out the basic skyline of the vCity.  Much later, we could reconsider our "freesteader" policy if we wanted to.  In the meantime, by "giving away" that which was infinitely available, we sacrificed nothing and gained goodwill with potential customers.
<P>	Again, we were surprised by the quality of the engagement.  We assumed that most corporations would register a parcel or a city block somewhere in <A HREF="cityce03.htm">HQ District</A>, erect a largely pre-fabricated VR office building, and set up the VR equivalent of a billboard.  We even planned to study the demographics of the vCity in order to make a case for charging for advertising space.
<P>	Instead, what we discovered was that companies were setting up simmcorps not to be recognized or discovered, but to do DDT&E (Design, Development, Testing & Evaluation).
