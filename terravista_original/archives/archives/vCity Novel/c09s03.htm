<P>In uptown, to the west of Confluencia on the other side of the three rivers, there is an area called the vCity Internet University or "VCIU" for short.  Many people think that VCIU is a simmcorp, but it is not.  It is actually registered in the U.S. state of Delaware as Virtual City Internet University, Incorporated.  It is a for-profit corporation whose stock is held principally by its employees -- the administrators, managers, engineers, and teachers.  University employees receive their salaries in the form of convertible stock, but they also receive cash commissions for bringing in revenue.
<P>In this system, the highest paid professionals are actually the teachers (content & analysis providers), since it is they who bring in the most revenue from the mass base of students (end-users).  The heart and soul of the VCIU as a means for the expression and communication of knowledge is its computer network hardware and software.  In a nutshell, the VCIU network links those who wish to teach with those who wish to learn.
<P>The fundamental principle of the education business is that students (end-users) must cover the costs of teachers (content providers).  By charging for library research or education on a per-use basis, VCIU encouraged efficiency throughout the entire system.  First of all, students didn't goof off while learning, because it was <I>their</I> money that was being seamlessly transferred to the university.  Secondly, teachers didn't waste time or effort with irrelevancies, because they quickly lost their student base.  Within a matter of days, in fact.  Professors quickly learned how to attract large swarms of end-users, either by providing quality content, insightful analysis, or outright amusement (like clowns at a circus).
<P>The buying and selling of education-minutes is effected by sophisticated VCIU software, the details of which will remain unpublished for obvious reasons.  Basically, information content is encrypted and keyed by password.  Therefore, it is not only impossible to "eavesdrop" on a discussion group or read material provided by a teacher, but also impossible to reproduce that information (unless the teacher codes it for reproducibility in either electronic or hard-copy form).  As far as VCIU knows, no one -- including the National Security Agency -- has ever cracked its security.  But it allows students to try.  For a fee, of course.  And if anyone does figure out this ultimate hack, why then, s/he would easily be able to get a job with the university as a security expert.  Or with any terrorist and/or government organization in the world.
<P>The efficiency of  the VCIU was staggering to education professionals.  Back in '98, the average cost of education-minutes was approximately $0.30/minute, figured by dividing total tuition costs by credit hours, not including incidental costs and lost opportunity income.  The average billable cost of an education-minute channeled through VCIU today is approximately $0.08/minute.
