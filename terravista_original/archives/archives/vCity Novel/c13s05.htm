<P>Another example of technological choice was the power system.  We knew right away that this one was going to cause no end of controversy.  Modern civilization runs on electricity.  That simple declarative sentence was a novel truth for most of North America and Europe by 1930, and the rest of the world by 1960, but by 1997 it hardly even merited a yawn.  Which made the fragility of existing centralized power production and distribution networks all the more puzzling.  We figured it must have had something to do with either economics, politics, or ignorance.
<P>Our solution was to decentralize the power grid.  We wouldn't have bothered to tweak the tiger by the tail, but in the U.S. the tiger -- that is to say, electric utility companies -- started to horn in on <I>our</I> territory, so we figured we'd hit <I>them</I> below the belt with some daring futurism.
<P>Electric power consumption is something everyone can understand at the local level.  Turn the switch, the appliances work, and at the end of the month one gets a bill from the power company for the number of kilowatts consumed.  Strangely, it never seems to work in the <I>opposite</I> direction.  Suppose that one decided to place a generator in one's backyard.  One links it up to one's house, and one can run all one's appliances, no fuss, no muss.  Let's say, in fact, that this generator generates more electricity than one can use personally.  Why not sell the surplus kilowatts to the power company?
<P>Why not?  Because they don't want to <I>buy</I> it, that's why not.  And why is that?  Well, partially because dealing with hundreds of thousands of electricity sellers is a bit of pain in the posterior, admittedly.  But the fundamental reason is that power corporations don't want to encourage competition.  If everyone starts generating electricity, then the overall price per kilowatt goes down, and how then are they going to pay off the loans they borrowed to build power plants and networks?
<P>In the real world, if one starts trying to sell electricity to one's neighbors, a nice friendly local law enforcement officer will likely drop by for a visit, followed in rapid succession by various legal representatives.  Actually, sometimes it works.  As long as people agree to incorporate, be regulated and supervised by the government, and pay corporate taxes, there's nothing illegal about becoming a power company.  It depends on the laws of the state.  Some towns in the U.S. and elsewhere do it.  And the big power companies do, in fact, buy kilowatts from them.
<P>Anyway, we decided that in the vCity, and thus in the world of the future, every citizen and every corporation would have the "legal" right to produce electricity at the local level of domicile, building, or facility.  There would be no single power company per se, but rather hundreds of thousands of them, some very small, and some very large.  Electricity would be purchased from, or sold to, the "open market".  The price of a kilowatt would fluctuate and depend upon instant market conditions of supply and demand at the instant of purchase or sale.  All of this would be monitored presumably by some pretty sophisticated telecomm and financial network software operated by the vCity Electrical Power Information Center.
<P>One of the interesting side effects of decentralizing power generation, we figured, is that it would give individuals an additional monetary incentive to conserve when demand is high.  With the correct freeware they would know exactly when to produce electricity for sale and/or cut back what they are buying to make the highest profit.
<P>We figured that the major political/economic difference between the vCity power distribution network and those currently in the real world is that in the future, private corporations would operate pieces of the network for profit, but wouldn't <I>own</I> any of it.  The people would retain title to every meter of cable/line right up to private property.  Local government would rent a local area power network for a high monthly fixed fee, but would deduct the cost of replacements and improvements from either rent or annual taxes.  We guessed that this would encourage private power distribution companies to operate efficiently and spend lots on refurbishment in order to really boost their real and paper profits.  The local citizens would retain the right to kick out a bad "power distribution" tenant.  So good customer service would be a must.  What a concept.
