<P>A word about the difference between dirigibles and balloons.  A dirigible is what used to be called an "airship", sometimes is now called a "blimp", and uses hydrogen and/or helium-filled containers or modular structures to provide lift for passengers or cargo, and engine-driven propellers for thrust and directional maneuverability.  A balloon is a sack that can be filled with air which, when heated, provides lift for passengers or cargo.  A balloon has no internal power and must go where the wind takes it.  Great for a tourist jaunt and sporting, but irritating for any kind of regular transportation.
<P>From the beginning of the vCity concept, I had argued for the inclusion of dirigibles not just as scapps, but possibly to allow people to "fly" legally and within the laws of physics throughout the vCity.  Ever since the Hindenburg disaster, dirigibles have received a bum rap.  They are seen in the public eye as cumbersome, slow, dangerous, expensive, and (sin of sins) low-tech.  This is unfortunate, since with modern equipment they are superbly capable of filling some market niches at low pollution cost.  For example, hauling bulk cargo to and from mountains, islands, or sea-based platforms where running tracks or roads would either be prohibitively expensive or impossible.
<P>I argued that dirigibles, and to a lesser extent balloons, could also be used also for advertising and specialty projects such as providing video coverage of a selected area (useful for sporting events and security).  Floating billboards, cameras, and telecomm links.  Etcetera.
<P>The Zoning Council remained unconvinced, so I added one other possibility: the House-Dirigible or "No Foundation Domicile".  People are familiar with the concept of the houseboat and the luxury yacht.  These are legal residences which float upon the water.  Why not a residence that floats on the air?  The legal address registration for House-Dirigibles, I argued, could be a D and B Complex.
<P>Well, I won that one, to the delight of the DOT contractors.  As it stands now, if someone wants to live above the vCity they can do so, provided that they obey certain civilized rules.  For example, a dirigible resident mustn't stray from registered flight paths.  In the real world, I imagine dirigible residents also would have to test their engines regularly, keep an ear well-tuned for the weather report, avoid tall buildings, and not dump garbage or sewage on people down below.  They would also be limited to wireless telecomm links, which would probably restrict their access to certain kinds of information and entertainment.
