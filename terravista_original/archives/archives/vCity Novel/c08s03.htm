<P>As a result, the First Law of vCity development once again reared its ugly head: Expect the Unexpected.  People started <I>buying</I> and <I>selling</I>, with real world money, the right to "occupy" zoning volumes in Buena Vistas.
<P>I thought this was stupid and said so through many editorials in various nowlinks.  Why in God's name would people purchase what they could obtain for free?  The supply-demand equation existed only within our simulation; if somebody wanted a virtual beachfront, they could just create it.  They could create a whole new world consisting of nothing but beachfront if they wanted to.  And it would only be a few internetworked seconds away.
<P>I also thought leasing ZVs was irritating.  When someone applied for and received a city registry, all that meant was that the CCs in our simulation referred to real world IP addresses.  If an IP address were no longer valid or "active", we would remove the registration and assign a new one either to someone on a waiting list or the next available customer.  To avoid losing the registration, the original owner would create and maintain a valid HTML or VRML-based web page that would provide a simple link to someone else.  This created a confusing tier of "signposts" before one could actually scroll to a VR view.
<P>In PC-based mode this was bad enough, but with HMD or MSE, it was downright barfogenic.  It was similar to walking into a sudden, unexpected blank wall.  Very disconcerting.
<P>So the Empire struck back, and the Zoning Council decided to ban "signposting".  In other words, even if a ZV registered valid, active IP addresses, it could be <I>banned</I> if it did not immediately conform to zoning ordinances.
<P>There was a loophole, however.  vCitizens could legitimately request a change of IP address for their ZV registry.  We made this an automatic process for obvious reasons.  So as it happened, those who "leased" their ZV to others for real world money could do so simply by changing the IP address in the registry.
<P>This was perfectly legal, but I found it irritating as hell.  Just as I got comfortable with the look of one house -- say, a sturdy tudor mansion -- it would be gone, replaced by a fashionably bizarre California-style ranch.
<P>Oh well.  We have a saying: "the vCity: it grows on you."
