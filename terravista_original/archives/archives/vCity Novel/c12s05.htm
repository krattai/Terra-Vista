<P>Actually telefraud and telecrime is not as big a concern as people first thought it was going to be.  Internetworking corporations discovered ten years ago -- to their dismay, I might add -- that most people don't purchase stuff over the Internet.  Businesses do, but consumers don't.  This miffed quite a few investors, who witnessed excellent growth in mail order business from consumers and assumed that the Internet would provide a logical electronic extension.  According to our market analysis, however, consumer confidence in buying and selling over the Internet will not happen for another ten years, until 2012.
<P>Why?  Why are people reluctant to transact electronically?  I think it must have something to do with instinct.  This preference for tangible wealth probably goes back to a time when mammals lived or died according to the size of their cache or their ability to hoard food.  The key breakthrough was to substitute tokens or coins for real value -- the first step towards a virtual reality economy.  The second step proved much harder.  It took forever to get people to electronically deposit pay cheques to their checking accounts, for God's sake.  Banks built up an incredible electronic infrastructure and capital investment to hand out paper cash to people at automated teller machines.  If <I>that</I> wasn't bizarre, I don't know what was.
<P>Anyway, the solution is the New Millennites, bless their hearts.  They've never known a world without personal computing.  They are the Chairborn, and it is their destiny to rush in where angels fear to tread.
