<P>The coup de grace, however, was delivered by corporate personnel managers and those Human Resources professionals who set hiring policies and staffing requirements for most of the transnational corporations around the world.  The university system, after all, had been created for their convenience.
<P>The idea that a university degree symbolized a standardized or minimal level of knowledge was important in order to save time for managers wishing to hire for a particular position.  It allowed them to sort and sift resumes initially without talking to the applicants.  The same applied to the exam-and-grading system, which had been established neither by students nor teachers, but by managers and administrators who had sought a cheap and effective way of determining relative value.
<P>The dirty secret of the university system, however, was that it had functionally broken down in many parts of the world.  By the late 1990s it was painfully obvious that many students graduating universities, so-called "freshouts", did not in fact have a significant grasp of their professed areas of expertise; furthermore, with the onslaught of massive grade inflation, the process used to determine relative value had become useless.  More and more, managers were forced to initially examine individual applicants and talk with them, even though the resumes hinted at some level of competence.  What the hiring managers discovered was that people who had acquired knowledge electronically were no more or less ignorant than people who had learned via a physical university.
<P>The net result was that corporations accepted the validity of a VCIU degree and judged its value as roughly commensurate with that of a "real" university degree.  Since the virtual university concept offered so many other advantages, and since a VCIU education was roughly 70% cheaper to acquire than its real-world counterpart, there was no end to the amount of market share that virtual universities might grab.  The early participants in VCIU made small fortunes selling their VCIU stock at 100 times its original value.
