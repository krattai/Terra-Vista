vHome 1:
I'm currently into green... deep forest green... with a
white picket fence and a cat on the porch railing and a
field of wild-flowers blowing lazily in the wind...
(hey, if I'm gonna dream, it's gonna be good!)

I suppose if it's green, it's painted wood, which is
lovely in that it will not wear in the weather, and
painting it a new color will probably be a breeze...
I'm seeing a stone fireplace... hardwood floors...
bearskin rug ...

Roof?  Well I dunno... shingles?

White picket fence... flowers, yes!  Big live-oaks
cradling the house...

I guess we could go primitive with a log cabin and
thatch roof... cooking over a fire... freshly ground
coffee from coffee beans grown in the field in the back

Porch swing... horses grazing... crickets chirping (hey
do we get background sound?)  If so, definitely a
babbling brook!

Mountains in the distance and nice view of waterfall in
the distance that slows to a babbling brook as it
approaches the house...

I want open spaces but surely neighbors!  Why, you of
course... you can drop by for Morning coffee!
hey (rat)... can you paint my house white instead of
forest green?  I just realized the entire landscape
will be green ('cept the water) and the white in
contrast would be lovely... like an old, restored
Antebellum home... front porch the length of the place
with porch swing & rocking chairs... tall ceiling,
hardwood floors, um... think "Gone with the Wind"...
but with the mountains, water, field of wildflowers,
long dirt road leading up to it, flanked by huge,
overhanging live oaks that form canopy... that babbling
brook fed by the waterfall off the mountains in the
distance... mmmmm...

vHome 2:
an apartment with lots of
kids, a swimming pool, close neighbors, in an artsy
community, with many leftist political orgs all around ...

a heated pool 
lots of artsy galleries and bookstores and coffee houses

building - brick - old - and the neighborhood filled with big old
houses and trees 

the houses r close together when holidays come everyone
decorates and rilly gets into it - 

want  a big pool (2/3 olympic size)

my level and down a little to the pool level ...

the neigjhborhood houses are wood mostly some are brick -- no
basements here

have room forout of town guests ...
a horseshoe shaped building curved around the swimming pool

3 story step down to pool up to my level - one level
above me

there are shops, restaurants, galleries and live
theatre nearby - artsy kind ... small
old quaint

like row house a little farther apart than you'd see
in San Fransisco - but short one-story and wide and no
two are alike - this is not suburbia ...(thank god)

maybe eight feet apart for some maybe 15 for others ...
occassionall 20 feet apart but not so much 

apartment building is brick and stucco - brownish
brick pinkish stuco with white wrought iron fencing
around the pool and scalloped wrought iron railing on
my level and the one above me (to keep folks from
falling).

Big trees

some businesses intermingled - most are on the main
street three blocks away west, one block south or four
blocks north

Many of the businessses are massage, zen stuff, buddhist temple, 
dance studie, antiques, hair salons, coffe houses, jazz 
theatre/coffee house

south are video stores, convenience stores, little
restaurants not so quaint - west are bookstores, quaint
and artsy everything north the same and a good sized
park with lots of playground equipment

The bedrooms in the apartmeny building should be 3 bedrrom 1100 
square feet.

should have large grassy area between building and 
street - a parking area should be in back, hidden

neighborhood houses all have nice (not immaculately
manicured) lawns and trees. Some yards have fences most
dont. Some are small along one stretch near here houses are two story 
almost antebellum looking

big sidewalk out front pool is shaped like Italy - it's blue has 
cement and tiles

A BIG kitchen and dinning area (I love having dinner
parties)

A fireplace (tho it hardly gets cold enough for one)

lots of bookshelves

insets in the walls for books and stuff - inset
lighting a place to do art sketches/paintings (besides

vHome 3:
Ideally my home would be a three-story Victorian in white painted wood.
 There would of course be a porch across the front with pretty trimwork and a
front door with an oval stained glass covering most of the door.  Can we have
furniture and plants?  If so, there would be white wicker rockers on the
front porch and leafy green ferns hanging from the ceiling.  Perhaps a table
for mint juleps and such.  There would be a sidewalk leading up to the door
and a woodsy looking variety of wildflowers surrounding the front porch.
 Trees would surround the house as if it were secluded, although there would
be a footpath through the woods!  If you were looking at the
house you would see lights in the windows from lamps with fringed shades.
 You could see a second story with a balcony french doors leading into a
room.  As you walk through the front door there would be a staircase and a
landing that you could see from the foyer.  This would lead to the second
floor but back to the first there would be a large kitchen with a fireplace,
a couple of overstuffed chairs with ottomans would face the fireplace, and
there would be a small table there for intimate dinners.  Shelves of favorite
books and collectibles would be on either side of the fireplace.  Glass
french doors would off of this room would lead into the backyard where you
could see the lake and occasionally would spot a bass jumping out of the
water You meander down a well-worn path and out onto the dock to fish or just
sit and enjoy coffee and peacefullness in the mornings.  Mmm I digress back
inside there would be a more formal but not stuffy living and dining room to
the left of the foyer large kitchen area would be to the right.  You would
walk up the stairs to a major large master bedroom with an ancient white iron
bed a feather comforter lots of pillows a bedside table piled with book,
magazines, coffee cups etc Maybe a canopy or gauzy white sheer fabric draped
around a canopy frame.  Another fireplace (gas logs that you could light with
the click of a match?) with chairs around and a table.  French doors would
lead out onto the balcony at the front of the house and a bay window would
look out over the lake that is surrounded by mountains at the back of the
house.  There could also be a guest bedroom with old antique furniture.  Now
this is the tricky part - there would be a secret passage from the master
bedroom leading up to a secret room that would be the third story It would be
a room with a desk, books, computer, coffee maker, comfy sofa, etc Shelves of
books and favorite pictures would line the walls another window overlooking
the lake you could see out but no one could see in.  I know this is a bit
detailed but I wanted you get the idea let me know what you think.

vHome 4:
Make my home from logs...

Build me a cabin...a log cabin
Nestled under cedars...stretching to reach the sky
Give my neighbors(the four-legged kind)
Space to roam freely

We'll commune with blue skies and puffy white clouds
During the day...twinkling stars at night
How awesome...this virtual home
Where South Carolina, Australia, Finland, and
Louisiana...can live side by side
Restructuring geography...what say?
Let my cabin have a door that says...
'WELCOME', to all...
Garden windows...
Embellished with frilly white curtains
Full of Green plants sprouting forth leaves
Newness of life
Morning Glories twirling around the posts
That hold up the umbrella roof of love
A garden plot for veggies
A fence to lean upon

Pebbled walks...birdhouses full
A stream flowing outside my kitchen window
That opens out...so I can shout a 'Good Morning'

vHome 5:
If you must know, White brick, BIG colonial, magnolias, 
azaleas, dogwoods, boxwood heges... nice pond out back 
with gazebo. Wrap around porch on house w/deck out back 
for entertaining... you get the pic!

vHome 6:
> What's it made of? (stone, brick, wood, igloo (haha) etc.)

tarpaper shack


> What color?

assorted degrees of squalor



> What surroundings? (mountains, river, pond, trees, etc.)
> 
> Just write a little narrative about what it would look like!

the dOghouse is a little like that crooked house with the crooked cat
and 
mouse - you know the one? It is devoid of siding and there is junk and 
old smashed-up trucks and heavy equipment all around the dOgyard - huge 
dump truck axles sticking up out of a pile of metal like big, rusty 
bonez...

there are all kinds of scrawny mangy lookin critters around the outside 
and hanging out the windows and stuff - goats, chickens (lots of 
chickens), sheep, cows, pigs, you get the picture...

vHome 7:
so my home....lessee....

hm, perhaps it'll be made out of bricks, and wood, and have lots of 
glass...big beautiful windows and a gazebo out back, leading to a 
pool...around the house, it'll be forestish, and there will be a huge 
garden, with a grape arbor of some sort...oh, and I'd like to have a 
smallish waterfall type thing with cool goldfish in a little pond, and a 
fountain somewhere around....hehe

What a dream, eh? But why not? If you could have any kind of house you 
want, it might as well be the dream house...only problem is making it 
come true...:)
</pre>

<pre>
vHome 8:
The house is set back in a grove of silver
birch trees. Soft moss and rocks in a garden that has
no flowers except in spring when a few rare flowers -
the color of ice - rise through the moss.  It is dark,
but not gloomy. 
The feeling, when you approach the house is slight
trepidation. Maybe you can hear a cello playing soft
and mournful through the glass of a stained glass
window. A candle flickers... a drift of blue woodsmoke
climbs into the sky and far far away there is the
growing sound of an electrical storm.  If you look
closely you will see that few feet have trod the path
to the front door.  Open it. Heavy rosewood... inside
the cello has changed to a violin concerto ( a slow
movement)  The furnishing is sparse... covers are over
some chairs.. the fine woodwoork has dust on it... It
is not sad - rather it is strange.  I live in this
house. I write  I wait.  I have a photograph of an old
friend near the fire... and two pillows on the bed. My
friend has never visited. At least not in the last 10
years.  But good wine, and simple food awaits... and in
the study, beside the fire... there are stories to be
heard and poetry that will rip your heart from your
breast. The host is generous... but always... he has
something in another room he would like to share with
you... but can you open that door?

vHome 9:
Well, don't give me too much freedom of choice, it'll be a little universe...

> What's it made of? (wood, brick, stucco, etc...)
Bricks could be cool.

> What color?

pastel/hazy earth colors, warm tones or stone grey, whitish or light
tan/red/yellow. I'm not that exact.

> What surrounds it? (woods, ocean, mountains, lake, plains, etc...)
> 
Ocean, maybe some islands visible, ...and/or plains. That's my neighbourhood
like, BTW.

> Take a minute to visualize it and put it into words... (I've turned into
> the collecter of dream-home-visions!)... and I'll pass it on

Hey, I just got an idea, it could be a cave by the sea! 
Do you have/got an access to/know the record 'Caverna Magica' by
Andreas Wollenweider?  Well, if you could find the record(cover) there's my
home on the cover picture, readily visualized. A library might be a good
place to search. It's easy to find over here.

'The Magic Cave', I kinda like that...

I think it's cool to live in a cave. Donno 'bout you, tho, would you mind
a piltdown man as a neighbour...
