Terra Vista has decided it was about time the content authors,
 people developing the VRML spec, and the companies designing
 the tools, recieved the recognition they deserve.  As a result
 the original
 <A HREF="origrel0.htm">release</A>
 was issued on the Terra Vista mailing list back on August
 9th, 1996.

 the makers of the 
<img src="../images/vrsolut2.gif" alt="V-Realm gif" align=bottom
 width=125 height=100 border=0>
Suite</a> have commited to a very genrous offer for a total
 of US$10K value of gifts to the award winners.  The
 award ceremony will be taking place on-line and IDS will
 be providing the browser to enable the event for multi-user
 avatar and voice.  A link will be provided to the download as
 the event approaches.
<p>
At present, both Howard Rheingold and Jaron Lanier have offered
 tentative agreements to participate in the event as guest
 speakers.  As well, Robert Saint John has accepted to be a
 guest at the event as a speaker.
<P>
To the winner of an award will go the recognition duly deserved
 for a job well done, as well as a commemerative award in the
 form of a custom designed graphic and VRML object.
  At
 this time I would like to thank IDS for their generous offer
 as well as their sponsorship of the event.
<P>
If there is enough interest, the event will be spread across
 three days starting on December 6th and running to December 8th.
  Day one (Friday) will consist of an open house in the nominee
 showcase.  Day two will be the Awards Ceremony itself.  Finally,
 the third day will be for mini-seminars which will be conducted
 in multi-user enabled VRML "rooms".  The seminars would involve
 speeches and debates on the technology of VR and VRML and the
 history and future of our great industry.
<P>
So, I would invite all of you to sit down, buckle your virtual
 seat belts, and be prepared to witness and participate in the
 future!  It all points to a very exciting time as we approach
 a culmination and integration of _many_ hard years of work by
 leaders in the industry.  May we all wake up to a brand new,
 brave world.  Thank you for your interest and participation.
  You may get your browser at the door.  Please park your
 horse in the back, by the trough.  Len, mind getting your spaceship
 off the roof...  =)
