<pre>
I am Bernie Roehl.  I do software development and system administration
for the Electrical and Computer Engineering department of the University
of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada.  I'm the co-author of "Using VRML"
(recently published by Que) and a regular columnist for Virtual Reality
Special Report, VR News and WebSMITH.  I've authored two other books on
virtual reality, and am probably best known in VR circles for REND386
and AVRIL (two freeware VR libraries for the PC platform).

I got into VRML because of my prior interest in VR.

I'm interested in helping to design and construct one of the first true
virtual communities.  My main area of contribution will likely be on the
technical end of things.
