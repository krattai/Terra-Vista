Dr. Gruen is a historian of technology with specialties in the
history of aerospace and civil and structural engineering.  He
received his Ph.D. from Duke University in 1989.  In 1984 he
moved from Durham N.C. to Washington, D.C. on a Guggenheim
fellowship at the (U.S.) National Air & Space Museum, and
stayed in the area ever since.  From 1985-1993 he served as
Director of NASA's Space Station History Project; in February
1994, he began working for MCI as their corporate historian.

His interest in VRML was sparked in autumn 1994 while doing
research on the history of the Internet.  In late 1994, he began
writing the vCity novel and finished it in August 1995.

Dr. Gruen's interest in helping guide the development of terra
vista is not purely altruistic.  He figures this is history in
the making, and he intends to write the definitive (!) history
of these pioneering days before any other professional historian
does.
