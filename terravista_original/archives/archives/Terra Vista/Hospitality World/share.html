<B>The Basics Of This Program</B>
<P>
<IMG SRC=1.jpg align=left>This program has several items that may or may not be a part of a screen. The first are the various menus. The first of which is common to almost every Windows® program. The menu bars.
<P>
The menu bar contains drop down menus that are normally titled File, Edit, View, etc. In this program various reports can be accessed under the File option by selecting either Print Preview or Print.
<P>
At the bottom of most of the screens will appear three buttons. One will have a picture of a +, used for adding records, another will have a picture of a garbage can, used for deleting records, and another will say Close, used for closing the screen.
<P>
At the very bottom of the screen there are navigation buttons used to navigate from record to record. The first button will have a |< that will take you to the first record, next to it will be a button that has a < that will take you to the previous record. Conversely the button that has a >| goes to the last record and the > button will take you to the next record.
<P>
Below the Navigation buttons in the status bar. When the cursor is on a field the status bar will normally display text that will describe what type of information should be entered in to the field with the cursor on it.
<P>
<B>The Screens</B><P>
<IMG SRC=2.jpg ALIGN=LEFT>After you have installed this program and you open it you will be confronted with the Main Menu.
This menu has four buttons, named Titles, Company Info, Employees, and Financial. The order of the buttons is the order in which they should be used.
<P>
First click on the Titles button one time. This will open the Titles screen.
Here you should enter all of the possible position titles within your company. Notice there is also a check box titled Owner. If the title is associated with upper management that will receive the 50% of the profits NOT allocated to normal employees then check this box for that title.<IMG SRC=3.jpg ALIGN=RIGHT>
<P>
Once all of the titles have been entered click once on the Close button. Note, if you forget to enter a title you can always come back and add it.
<P>
Once you close the Titles screen you should be back at the Main Menu. Now click the Company Info button to open the Company Info screen.<P>
<IMG SRC=4.jpg ALIGN=left>
This screen is obviously used to enter information about your company. Notice that below the Company Name, Address, City, State, Zip, and Phone fields there is a large box titled Logo. If you have your company's logo saved on your computer you can place it in this box by following the steps below:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	Copy your logo onto the Windows® clipboard using a program like Paint Brush®
<LI> 	Enter this program and go to the Company Information screen.
<LI>	Click once on the Logo box.
<LI> 	Select Paste from the Edit menu at the top of the screen.</OL>
<P>
Your logo and company information will appear on various reports that you can produce using this program.
<P>
Once you have finished entering your company's information press the Close button.
<IMG SRC=5.jpg ALIGN=LEFT><P>
You should be back at the Main Menu.  Now press the Employees Button to open the Employees screen.
<P>
The Employees screen has a couple of different sections. The first section contains the fields labeled First, Last, Address, City, State, Zip, and Title. The information that is required for these fields should be obvious. Notice that the field labeled Title is a combo box that will list the titles that you entered in the Title screen earlier.
<P>
The second section is the section titled Salary. This section is contained in a finite area but can handle an infinite amount of data. Simply enter the last day of your company's fiscal year into the field Year Ending, the total amount of gross earnings that the employee received for the fiscal year in the field Ending Total Pay and that's it.
<P>
The fields titled Adjustment and Amount Paid will be automatically filled in once you have finalized the year in the Financial screen, which I will get to shortly.
<P>
The last section of the screen should be somewhat familiar with the exception of two new objects. There is a combo box with a label Find Employee and a button immediately to the right that has a picture of a funnel with a red X next to it. 
<P>
The combo box titled Find Employee is a filter. The way it works is pretty simple. If you have a lot of employees you would want a way to find a particular employee without having to scroll through them all. The data that appears in the Find Employees combo box are the names of every employee. Simply select the employee you are looking for and their information will appear in the fields above. If you have 100 employees you would see that the navigation buttons at the bottom of the screen might say something like record 3 of 100, which would mean that you are on record 3. After using the filter the navigation buttons would say record 1 of 1. So what happened to the other 99 records? Don't worry they are still there but remember that the Find Employee combo box is a filter. By using this field you have filtered out all of the records that did not match what you entered in Find Employee. To show all the records simply click on the button immediately to the right of the Find Employees button.
<P>
Once you have entered all of the information for your employees press the Close button to return to the Main Menu. 
<P>
From the Main Menu press last button called Financial. This will open the Financial Screen.
<P>
At first this screen might look intimidating because of all the information that it contains. In reality there are only a few pieces of information that you need to provide to make it work properly.
<P>
In the field titled Fiscal Year End Date enter the last day of your company's fiscal year. In the field titled Gross Sales enter the amount of the gross sales your company had for the fiscal year. In the field titled Expenses enter the TOTAL amount of expenses that you company incurred during the fiscal year.
<P>
The field titled Net Profit will automatically show the difference between Gross Sales and Expenses. The two sections listed below titled Employees and Management will display the names of the employees and management based on the titles that you assigned them in the Employee screen and if that title was marked Owner in the Titles screen.
<P>
The name of each employee, their salary, % of Total salary that they received when compared to the rest of the employees listed in either Management or Employees, and Adjustment (which you can now enter) and finally the Amount Due to the employee at the end of the fiscal year.
<P>
Once you have checked all of this information and have made any adjustments to the Adjustment fields you can then click once on the button titled Finalize.
<P>
<img src=7.jpg align=left>After clicking on this button a small dialog box will appear.
<P>
You will be presented with two reports that you can print. If you want this program to print personalized letters to each employee that you can mail or hand to them then select the Letters report. If you want to just print a summary and print your own letters or maybe you need to get approval from some higher power before you print letters then select the Summary report. Remember, you can always come back and press the Finalized button again and access these reports.<P>
