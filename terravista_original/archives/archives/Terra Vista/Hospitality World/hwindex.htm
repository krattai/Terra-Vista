<B>Overview:</B>
<P>
Hospitality World is the multi-dimensional development of Virtual Communities by:
<UL>

<LI>	Company
<LI>	Industry
<LI>	Product
<LI>	Services
<LI>	Culture
<LI>	Ethnicity
<LI>	Life Style

or by location such as:<P>
<UL>
<LI>	Neighborhood
<LI>	City
<LI>	County
<LI>	State
<LI>	Region
<LI>	Nation	
<LI>	International</UL>
<P>

which will evolve through common interests and goals. These communities are not limited to these categories and will be determined on the basis of inter-dependence for mutual benefit.
<P>
The foundation of the community will be a gathering of people by mind thought energy who believe that mankind has the knowledge for balanced personal and social transformation. This knowledge will be reflected by action that speaks louder than words. It will recognize that it is more important how we treat others than what we think they believe. We will understand that mankind is all one in the global village and by helping others we help ourselves. We will communicate through, Hospitality World, the science of human relationships for short term operational objectives and  long-term personal and philosophical goals.
<P>
Commerce and employment provide the basic resources for a community to operate. Hospitality World has developed a model software program, "Share the Wealth," that compensates investors and employees in a system of balance. Investors are recognized with a fair return on investment and each employee shares in the profits recognizing their contribution to the total success of the business. The major asset in any activity is its people.
<P>
<B>HISTORY</B>
<P>
In 1996, Don Drumm, artist, sculptor, and philosopher, a long time friend of Spiro Goumas, introduced him to Jim Naus, operator of a cyber cafe, Coffee Configur@tions near the University of Akron. This introduction was the seed that began to develop a Hospitality World strategic alliance organizing team that has the vision and the talent to implement Hospitality World concepts.
<P>
Through Jim, Spiro was introduced to Don Mayer and Suzi John, owners of pidwanger productions, an innovative new multi-media and internet content development team in Massillon, Ohio. During several of the initial meetings of this group, Spiro relayed his philosophies of balance and asset distribution within the food industry specifically, and in the universe in general. Sparks began to fly. With the internet as a communication medium, Spiro now revitalized his ideas about Hospitality World and began to realize that the means were now available to make this dream a reality.
<P>
The next entity to join the Hospitality World team was Cantec Communications, an internet service provider owned and managed by Dave and Rita Bigham, of Canton, Ohio. Dave is a QC Engineer for Bailey Controls in Cleveland and Rita is a teacher in middle school for the Massillon City Schools. This added the technical aspect to the team. Soon this group was meeting on a regular basis. Jim Naus has put Coffee Configur@tions up for sale and is now working full time developing and promoting Hospitality World and selling web sites for pidwanger productions. 
<P>
In July of 1997, the Hospitality World team added Randy and Marsha Linquist to the team. Randy is owner of Trivium Coffee Cafe with locations in Akron and Canton, Ohio and is also a writer/philosopher. His role in the Hospitality World concept is to assist in the development of newsletters, promotion of the Hospitality Concept ... and offers his restaurant as a meeting place. 
<P>
The Hospitality World headquarters are located in Bath, Ohio. The office there offers a meeting place for clients from the Cleveland area.
<P>
In the course of "growing" HW (it IS very organic), Don stumbled across Terra Vista, a multi-user VRML 3-dimensional community. Don's initial idea was to take this existing world and give it a sense of purpose and to assist in its development. He realized the vision and spirit were there, but the project lacked the vitality and focus necessary to survive. Don enthusiastically presented the idea of incorporating an existing "community" into the existing concept of Hospitality World to the HW board of directors, but was met with a lukewarm reception. It was a difficult concept to grasp. 
<P>
After several weeks of careful meditation and searching, Spiro realized that Don's idea was exactly what was needed to give Hospitality World its unified focus. The Terra Vistans teamed with pidwanger productions will be the developers and builders of the virtual community real estate. Terra Vista offered the community, Hospitality World offered the commerce. Separately, they were viable entities, but together they provide the balance necessary to their mutual success.
<P>
<B>IMPLEMENTATION:</B>
<P>
Hospitality World will plant the seeds and cultivate development of virtual communities in various categories, with a team that has the technical tools integrated with the philosophical wisdom to set in motion virtual communities for the purpose of personal and social transformation.
<P>
People within the following physical communities will provide the foundation for the corresponding virtual communities:
<OL>
<LI>	Food Industry Community following the entire food chain from agriculture through consumption of food.
<LI>	An industrial virtual community consisting of a warehousing manufacturing, logistics, and real estate development company that have practiced the principles of hospitality science.
<LI>	Established neighborhood communities earmarked for revitalization within the Akron/Cleveland, Ohio areas with prepared plans, people and resources.
<LI>	A global community with the infrastructure in place to extend their influence at an accelerated rate for personal and social transformation.</OL>
<P>
<B>Communications Vehicles:</B>
<P>
Information update and access will be key elements in the success of Hospitality World. It would be ideal if all Hospitality World members had access to the Internet and our member-exclusive web page. Unfortunately, that will not be the case - especially for the smaller or start-up enterprise. We will have to, therefore, make information available in a variety of media to satisfy our member obligations and requirements. We envision:
<UL>
<LI>	Web sites:
<UL>
<LI> Member-exclusive site with code-word access that will provide member services information, resource search mechanism, internet link to national and international hospitality organizations and industry publications.
<LI>General access site for membership, speaker & seminar information.</UL>
<LI>	News Bulletins and information regarding up-coming events and items of general interest will be sent to members in a graphically-engaging, departmentalized newsletter format via fax and broadcast e-mail.</UL>

<B>Hospitality World Replication</B>
<P>
The Hospitality World concept has been designed to have local, national and international application. For that to happen, however, it will be necessary to create a detailed "operations manual" that identifies the actual application of all the systems and philosophies embodied in this marketing outline.
<P>
This operation manual must include actual "templates" of all operational systems, computer programs, administrative forms and "how to" guides to successfully launch, grow and administer the Hospitality World concept.
<P>
This will give rise to local/national/international web sites as well as membership directories. Although each Hospitality World "cell" will predominantly service the needs of a local or regional operating area, it will have broader implications and resource capabilities as the organization grows. Eventually local, regional, national and international access capabilities will bring the Hospitality World concept to full potential.
<P>
<B>Cyber Cafe:</B>
The future of Hospitality World, and the industry, is in the concept of the "Cyber Cafe." It represents a physical and electronic gathering place much the same as the old English Public Houses. It is a place where individuals can interact on all levels - business, social, philosophical and economical - for their individual and collective benefit. It is the embodiment of mind and body balance. As more and more individuals avail themselves of electronic resources for all aspects of their personal and professional lives, a focal point of activity will become critical to their well-being from every aspect of their lives.
<P>
<B>Promotional Media:</B>
<P>
Although word-of-mouth will be a key mechanism for the initial launch and development of Hospitality World, sustained growth, both locally and beyond, will require a targeted media program for general awareness, member solicitation and industry credibility. When reviewing options, two vehicles make the most sense from a perspective of ROI and overall effectiveness:
<UL>
<LI>	Targeted "awareness" advertising in selected industry and local area publications with response mechanisms such as an Internet address and/or toll-free phone number.
<LI>	Direct response mailings to selected organizations, individuals or suppliers for member solicitation and/or speaker & seminar opportunities.</UL>

<P>
<B>Summary:</B>
<P>
Hospitality World is a new, enlightened way of looking at the necessary link between business and personal growth. To a great extent, business has been seen as distinct and separate from spiritual development and, in some cases, moral considerations.
<P>
We have seen over the years, however, that those businesses that succeed and prosper understand the absolute need for a holistic approach to business and personal growth. Spiro Goumas, founder of Hospitality World, views it as the universal need " ... to communicate the science of human relationships through the economic system of balance."
<P>
The ultimate goal of Hospitality World is a system of sharing and development that will enhance the total process of doing business, from concept to end user, in a balanced and equitable way that acknowledges and rewards the efforts of every individual who contributed to the success of the enterprise. Or, as Spiro states it, 
"Hospitality World is a gathering of business enterprises for profit
working together in balanced relationships."
<P>
<B>HOSPITALITY WORLD F.A.Q. SHEET</B>
<P>
<B>WHAT IS HOSPITALITY WORLD?</B>
<P>
Hospitality World is a philosophy of life that confirms we are spiritual beings living in a body. Mind, body, spirit, cannot be separated from our lives. Social, economic, or political, we need to maintain a universal balance. All actions of our lives reflect who we are.
<P>
Our institutions: family, education, religion, business, government, society are treated as separate entities. We have separated ourselves from our source, the universe. Anything that separates us from our origin is an illusion.
<P>
Money and food are basic physical and material needs. Hospitality World is a gathering of people who believe these two resources can effectively communicate "hospitality" as a science of human relations, providing a lifestyle to bring us in balance with the universe and each other.
<P>
The internet provides a unique opportunity to materialize these concepts to everyone, everywhere, anytime.
<P>
<I>Q.	Why is Terra Vista involved and what is in it for the Terra Vista community?</I>
<P>
A partnership in the Hospitality World concept offers Terra Vista free rent, a place to build and grow, a place to play, increased publicity, a chance to participate in a "social transformation."  This is a chance to take part in a new model of doing business with no strings or restrictions other than those that are self imposed. This can become a showcase for individual talents, a place to meet people, a place to check the local restaurant and movie schedules, or order a pizza online  ... the possibilities are endless!
<P>
Hospitality World will thrive because it works in balance and in cooperation with an established community of people who understand what a cyberspace community is all about. 
<P>
Where are you? What's going on in your town, village, state? This community will have no boundaries and is free to encompass the entire planet. 
<P>
<I>Q.	Who will be able to view the HW/TV communities?</I>
<P>
Everyone is welcome into the community. We may have areas that have restricted access such as private meeting rooms for industries and businesses, but the basic communal structure will be open to everyone. The concept is to allow this community to evolve freely. Restrictions will be applied if  and as necessary. The entire idea is to allow for a free evolution.
<P>
<I>Q.	What are the minimum requirements for access?</I>
<P>
We are targeting P100 with a decent video card as minimum specs, however this is not a restriction. Anyone can develop worlds aimed at slower machines. We are targeting the business end by designing today to be good tomorrow. The community end will be allowed to evolve to include everyone!
<P>
<I>Q.	Is the basis for Hospitality World within the confines of the "real world?" Are the buildings representing existing architecture?</I>
<P>
The buildings in the Hospitality World VRML representation are based on existing and potential new or transformed buildings. A business person who is proud of his existing location should have a showcase for his establishment. Central to transforming existing buildings is the concept of co-operative real estate where landlords can maintain their equity and allow tenants to become partners.
<P>
<I>Q.	Is the intent of the project to be for "entertainment," or are we trying to promote the associated companies through "traditional" advertising?</I>
<P>
Hospitality World seeks to avoid all traditional means of advertising. It is not opposed to displaying signs, etc., in business areas, but in the community area, we don't want people to feel bombarded with advertising, slogans. They get enough of that in the "real" world.
<P>
The actual means of presenting a business will have to be determined by the owner. It is our job to convince him that we are looking for interesting content and context. Most of the businesses who are interested understand this and are in full agreement.
<P>
<I>Q.	Do you have any more focused knowledge of our business target market, and is the purpose of Hospitality World to attract a "traditional" market to these companies, or are we looking for more?</I>
<P>
We aren't doing "traditional" anything. We are breaking the mold here! We are involved at the very root of designing a new paradigm, what Marilyn Ferguson calls a "social transformation." The rules are changing and we are at the core of writing the new rules. We have a groundwork of businesses and organizations and communities who realize this and are willing to work together to accomplish this.
<P>
As far as focused knowledge of our target, Spiro Goumas, originator of the HW concept, has some of the best contacts in diverse social, economic and political settings. We are already seeing the market expand astronomically and we are going to try to attract experts in each field with the same vision. 
<P>
We were fortunate enough to make acquaintance with Phillip Nabors,  the owner of the Mustard Seed Market in Fairlawn, Ohio. The Mustard Seed is rated as one of the best Organic Food Markets and restaurants in the country. Phillip looks like Pete Townsend with a pony tail, was sporting Bugs Bunny socks and red Converse All-stars. He has lived in communes and is very politically involved. He has appeared before senate committees with Ben Cohen (Ben & Jerry's) promoting the ban of Bovine Growth Hormones. His vision is to build a virtual market where one can click on any product and see its origin, how it is made, etc. He has done the necessary research. Nabors has the key for developing the food industry virtual community
<P>
We are doing nothing "traditional!"
<P>
<B>SUMMARY:</B>
<P>
Hospitality World as a concept was the evolution of a 30-year vision from Spiro Goumas's career experience in the food industry. This vision was formalized with graphics and philosophical writings in 1979. Hospitality World was incorporated in 1982 as a profit-making corporation. In 1993 it was activated with a Federal ID number as a food consulting company. Present technologies with the strategic alliance team gathering make the dream  possible working with the Universal Energy.
