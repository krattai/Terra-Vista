Knowing that VRML is a document and easily retrieved and
 stored on local clients as people come visiting your wrl,
 Adam Gruen

 offered the following solution:

<PRE>
However, it also seems to me that if the VRML design
community presents a united front, it can certainly
discourage copyright violations from taking place.

I am thinking, in this instance, perhaps of a bulletin
board or web community that might enable members
to air grievances about real or perceived violations;
that might be available to present a common letter
of concern to violators; that might, in clear cases,
even be able to boycott or ostracize offenders.

No artistic community is entirely free from the
problems of plagarism and/or copyright violation.
It might not be too soon to start thinking about
how we, as a community, might respond to this
problem.
