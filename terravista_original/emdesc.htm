A lot of this still needs to be fleshed out further.  The following is
 excerpts discussing how this will all work:
<PRE>
One more project to hang on the loop, then I'm done for a bit in that 
area.

It's a longish story, the short being as follows:
A few more things yet to flesh out, but I believe we may be approaching
a critical mass where we can incorporate the three communities into a
vast MU VRML environment with a basis in Adam's vCity, the VRML
capabilities of Terra Vista, combined with the technology aspects
of John Gwinner, and the combined community base of (both communities).

~~~

OK, I'm putting things together in my mind, slowly on screen/paper...

It'll work something like this, just brainstorming here:
+ Build a MU enabled, VRML environment which anyone, even with a 486, 
8MB, 14.4 w/ Win 3.1 can navigate.
++ The VRML should be developed under the guidance of Adam Gruen in 
relation to vCity
++ The VRML should have multiple segments, each segment with a 
specific theme, each theme with buildings representing specific 
topics; Segment=Conference -> vHome=Topic
++ the grande scheme of things would basically have (the conference)
as a subset of vCity, vCity being a Zone within Terra Vista, so 
(the conference) would essentially be a Segment or set of Segments 
within the vCity Zone.  An entertainment spot, if you will.
++ Each topic would have an "archiving station".  If there was no-one 
there, you could go to the "whiteboard" (which would be a link to (the 
conference text) associated Topic or smilar) and read the "writting on 
the wall" and leave a message of their own
+ negotiate a topic or jumping spot at (the conference) for the users 
to talk about things and to enter into the environment.
+ Distribute the VisIt software to all member of Terra Vista, 
(the conference), etc.  A link to download the software directly at the jump 
off space.

~~~

The user logs on to (the conference), as usual.  In a conference, let's 
say a VRML conference, will be a Jump Off topic.  It would be 
frozen so that the information contained is not lost.  The 
information would be a link to get the VisIt browser if they don't 
have it, and the link to the (conference) Zone.  The Zone will 
contain a number of different segments.  Each Segment pertaining to a 
topic at (the conference).  Although this is can get quite hary, we can 
easily set up a prototype around this.  As people move from 
Segment/Conf to Segment/Conf, they will see "rooms" or buildings.  
Each of these will relate to a Topic within the Conf.  Actually, I 
see a different vision where each Segment has little 
billboard/whiteboards which relate to the topic and the entire 
segment is live as a conf.  Anyhow, if there is no-one around, the 
person can click on the appropriate Topic and read messages and leave 
messages.
