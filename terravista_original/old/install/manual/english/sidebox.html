<font color="red"><u>PHP-Nuke Addons & Modules System</u></font>
<p align="justify">Since PHP-Nuke 5.0 you can add new modules, addons or plugins simply
copying the addons files into a directory. With this feature, PHP-Nuke
gains modularity and you, the webmaster, the choice to install and/or
unistall the modules you want with an easy step.<br><br>
Now this new idea come out from Rob Sutton is to make it even modular. Current module
system will force developer to edit mainfile.php especially if you want to add sidebox.
With this new system user don't have to worried anymore. As long you used the themes
come with the package. Woalla!<br><br>
This document has two main parts, one for webmasters/users and other
for Addons developers.<br><br>
Please read it carefully and remember that this system, as the whole
NukeAddOn comes without any warranty and all you do from here is under
your own responsability and risk. Always remember to backup your
database and all your files before doing anything.</p>

<font color="red"><u>1. Information for Webmasters/Users</u></font>
<p align="justify">The new sidebox system is now can be place easily without changing anything
on your mainfile. This way it's really modular. This system invented by Rob
Sutton and now bundle into our current AddOn.<br><br>
In order to make the box appear correctly you must have replace all themes
files include on NukeAddOn and then to add it you just need to create
a new sidebox. However you must replace the comment in the contents field
you need to place the exact URL where the modules script located. E,g. 
Calendar modules url are modules/Calendar/addonblock.php.</p>

<font color="red"><u>2. Information for Addons Developers</u></font>
<p align="justify">Making a new box addon with this system is pretty easy. Developer just need to know
a few rules:<br><br>
Create the scripts like usuall, you can view the example from a couple of my code.
However you need to put this into your theme.php which is the one who will call the
code out.<br><br>

# The Code<br>
#############<br><br>

if (file_exists($content)) {<br>
	$fp = fopen ($content, "r");<br>
	$content = fread($fp, filesize($content));<br>
	fclose ($fp);<br>
	$content = "?>$content<?";<br>
	echo eval($content);<br>
} else {<br>
	echo $content;<br>
}<br><br>
