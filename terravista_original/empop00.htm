VRML Conferencing

Members of the Terra Vista community are independandtly developing a
wrap for a currently existing Conferencing community.  This project will
be developed, prototyped and developed over the next few months.

This is a large project and can use as many helping hands as possible.
It will be based on a premise of Adam Gruen's vCity.  The Conference
itself will be a portion of vCity and will be a Zone within Terra Vista.
Each conference will be mirrored by a Segment within the Conference Zone.
Each Segment will contain links to the related conference topics.  The
project will include the VisIt browser developed by John Gwinner.

For more basics on how this will be developed, please go to the following

Hospitality World developers

In conjunction with Pidwanger Productions, Terra Vista would like to 
announce thier co-operative project, Hospitality World.  A Multi-User 
VRML 2.0 environment being developed for the Hospitality Industry.

With the concept in his mind, Don Mayer of Pidwanger Productions was 
pointed to the Terra Vista community as a potential resource pool and 
example of how the concept may be put into place.  After a short 
question and answer period, there appears to be a very good match 
between the Hospitality World concept and the Terra Vista community.  
It is viewed as a win-win for all involved.

Don was a participant on the Irish Space project and brings his 
experience in co-operative VRML space building to his new project.  
Don is looking at creating a co-operative Zone within the Terra Vista
environment.  With this Zone and an offer from the Hospitality World
members, there is quite a potential in this project.

Along with the Zone, Don has proposed/offered the following:
+ A server on which to place Hospitality World and related/linked 
VRML environments
+ A limited release CD on which will reside a mirror of all related 
files and some complimentary software and items

The benefit to Terra Vista will be increased exposure through links and
references, increased land mass within the Terra Vista context, and
benefit to Terra Vista members and participants in this project, 
through personal exposure.

As Hospitality World will be a Zone managed by Don, all material which
will be included in the Zone and the project must pass his inspection
and approval.  Once past that hurdle, the environments, etc will be
put in queue to be released on the CD.  This Zone and related sites 
will be MU VRML 2.0, with detail which will require a P100 minimum 
for processing.

Please contact the Terra Vista project if you are interested.
