<H3><A NAME="Intro">Introduction</A></H3>

<P>
This tutorial will teach you how to build a simple mud hut in
VRML. You should already know how to build a VRML container file,
including a header and a root node. This tutorial will also teach
you how to use the cylinder, cone, cube, translation, and material
nodes. Start off your file by typing the header and creating a
root separator node.

<H3><A NAME="Mud">The Mud Walls</A></H3>

<P>
The first step is to build the walls of the hut. We'll use a simple
cylinder for the walls and DEF (name) it &quot;walls.&quot; We'll give it a height of 1.5 and
a diameter of 2.0. Since the default diameter is 2.0 anyway, we
won't bother to enter the diameter field in the code.

<H3><A NAME="Thatch">The Thatch Roof</A></H3>

<P>
The next step is to add a roof to the hut. We'll put in a thatched
roof and use a cone to represent it.  Name it Roof.
<P>
If we just add a cone node within the roof separator, the cone
will appear centered at the same place as the walls: the roof
will be inside the walls. We want it on top, so we will add a
translate node before the cone. We want to put the roof exactly
above the walls, so we'll translate up (in the y direction). How
much we translate depends in part on how tall the cone is. Changing
the height of the cone moves the center of the cone (which is
what moves when we translate). We'll make the cone fairly flat
by defining the height as .  We'll also give the roof a little
overhang by defining the bottom diameter as .

<P>
Right now our hut is sort of floating out there in space.  If
we were inlining this world into a Terra Vista zone, that would
be exactly what we'd want, since Terra Vista will provide the
ground for us.  For this example, however, it's a little disorienting
to have our hut floating in space, so let's add some ground. 
The simplest way to add the terra firma is by adding a large,
flat cube.  Insert it in your file above the Walls, and give it
a height of 0.05, and a width and depth of 10.  Call it Ground.
Voila: a ten meter square ground appears.  If you look at the
world as it is right now, the ground is in the center of your
walls, bisecting your hut.

<P>
We forgot something!  We need to translate
the hut up (in the y direction) so that it sits on top of the
ground and not embedded in it.  Between the Ground and the Walls,
add a translation in the Y direction of meters.  This will raise
the hut.
<P>
Notice that it raises both the Walls and the Roof: the roof translation
begins where the walls translation ended, not from the origin.
 This is handy because it preserves the spatial relationships
we defined for these objects earlier.

<H3><A NAME="Paint">Painting the Scene</A></H3>

<P>
Right now the scene is pretty drab, as if we made the ground and
hut out of ashes or cement or something pretty gray.  We need
to add color to the scene using the material node.
<P>
The material node lets us define color in several different ways.
 We'll save the detailed exploration of the node for another tutorial.
 For now, we'll simply add a very basic material node before each
object we want to color.
<P>
First, add a material node called Grass above the Ground.  Give
it a specular color that is green with three numbers for the red,
green, and blue values that will combine to make green.
<P>
How did we know those colors would make green?  There are two
ways to figure this out.  The easiest is to obtain a VRML authoring
package that allows you to graphically define your colors with
some kind of tool.  That could be expensive too.  The second easiest
is to fiddle with the values until you get the color you want.
<P>
If you load the world now with the Grass material, you will find
that everything is green.  (&quot;I am the grass.  I cover all&quot;).
 This is because we have only one &quot;bucket&quot; of paint.

<P>
Add a second material node (called Mud) above the Walls.  Give
it a brown specular color.  Then add a third material node above
the Roof and call it Straw.  Give it a yellow specular color.
<P>
TaDa!  This simple mud hut world is complete!

<P>
Hokay, it's a complete mud hut, but it lacks a certain je ne sais
quoi.  You might perhaps add a Shrubbery!  Or, you might have
a pre-made object that you want to insert.  Try adding more to
the scene using the nodes and methods shown in this tutorial.
 Have fun and play around.
<H4>Summary</H4>

<UL>
<LI>Geometry nodes (like the cube, cylinder, and cone we used)
add objects to the scene whose dimensions (like height, width,
and diameter) you can change.
<LI>Translation nodes move objects to different places in the
scene according to the x, y, and z directions we select, but they
must be added before the object they move.  They also move every
subsequent object.
<LI>Material nodes allow us to &quot;paint&quot; the scene.  They
use three values for red, green, and blue to define colors.
</UL>

<H4>More Help?</H4>

<UL>
<LI>If this tutorial has you tearing out your hair and you want
more basic help understanding these nodes and how they work, there
are books that describe them in more detail.  If you are going
to code a lot of VRML, some type of reference book is a must.

explains each node, one at a time, and uses examples to show each
node.
