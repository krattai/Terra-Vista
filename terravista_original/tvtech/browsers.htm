<center><p>Almost as soon as the first Terra Vista prototype zone was created,
members of the community discovered that different browsers handled the
VRML standard differently, and not always correctly. To assist citizens
and visitors, we try to periodically test various browsers in Terra Vista
to report on how to use the browser to enter the community and to pass
on any information on browser behavior. </p></center>

<h2><a name="Intro"></a>Introduction </h2>

<p>Since Terra Vista has elected to strictly adhere to the VRML 1.0 standard,
we have noticed that a working, complete, bug free VRML 1.0 browser is
a hard beast to find. Very few browsers are out of the beta testing stage
of development for VRML 1.0, and already the race is on to develop VRML
2.0 browsers. That's life.</p>

<p>That said, we try to periodically test browsers in Terra Vista zones.
This helps us find out which browsers are supporting the standards, what
bugs exist, and how to use the browser effectively. It also helps us find
out when our own code is buggy. Then we post reports to this page. We should
emphasise here that these reports should not be the sole source of information
you use to evaluate a browser--our tests are not exhaustive or rigorous
enough.</p>

<p>We'd also like to thank the browser builders of the world, who make
our passion for virtual reality possible, generally at little or no cost
to us. We truly appreciate the effort you are putting into making cyberspace
possible.</p>

<h3><a name="System"></a>The Test Machines</h3>

<p>One test machine is a Dell XPS Pentium 133 Mhz with 16 MB of RAM and
a 28.8K connection running Windows 95. A survey of Terra Vista list members
places this machine somewhere in the lower middle of the pack. If you are
operating with a slower connection, slower CPU, or less RAM, you may experience
problems or slow performance building and browsing VRML. Computer prices,
fortunately, are still dropping. </p>

<p>Some additional tests have been performed with a Compaq 486 DX2 66 Mhz
machine with 8 MB of RAM. In general, we find that this machine does not
run some browsers as well, and we generally attribute this to the low RAM
of the system.</p>

<p><a href="#Top">Return to the Top</a> </p>

<h3>
<hr width="100%" ><a name="Params"></a>Test Parameters</h3>

<p>DISCLAIMER: Terra Vista testing is NOT rigorous. This testing started
(and ends) as an attempt to find out if a given browser will view Terra
Vista zones and segments. When we test, we zip around, consider certain
browser features, and make rough assessments of browser capabilities.</p>

<p>You <b>SHOULD NOT</b> rely solely on these reports when selecting a
browser. Many factors affect the performance of a browser and everyone's
machine is a little different. What bombs for us might scream on your machine,
and vice-versa. The browser makers are providing a lot of free evaulation
time. Take advantage of it and test drive until you find a piece of software
you like. Then pay for it like a nice user should.</p>

<p>That said, there are a few things we do try to evaluate as consistently
as we can.</p>

<h4>Rendering Speed</h4>

<p>Sadly, this test is something of a SWAG (super wild-ass guess) that
we take at how a browser runs. We wish that we could report with a high
degree of accuracy. We can't. We will simply report whether the browser
was brisk, moderate, crawling, etc. We will try to be as objective as possible.
We strongly encourage people to try a number of browsers out ON THEIR OWN
machines, since it is likely that a number of factors (processor, ram,
setup, video card, bus, drivers, accelerators, and so on.) could have an
impact on the speed of a browser's renderer.</p>

<h4>Rendering Accuracy</h4>

<p>This test is also a little more haphazard than we'd like. Rendering
accuracy evaluates whether the browser rendered the scene accurately. As
an example, some browsers have displayed ascii text nodes in unpredictable
ways.</p>

<h4>Response to Level Of Detail nodes</h4>

<p>This is the mother of all test parameters, and historically the reason
that these reports began to exist at all. Background: Terra Vista zones
include inlined worlds from various contributors, some or all of which
incorporate the Level of Detail (LOD) node. The idea behind this requirement
was to reduce browser loads for people viewing the world. We found out
two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Many browsers did not implement the LOD of inlined worlds correctly.
When the code was correct, the browsers would show the lowest level of
detail when the visitor was closest to the inlined scene. The highest level
of detail became visible as you backed away from the inlined world. It
was our feeble attempt to find a browser without this problem that led
to these reports. 
<br></li>

<li>After spending all this time, whizzing off browser builders by badmouthing
their software and in general causing quite a fuss, Terra Vista decided
not to require LOD after all. It does not seem (at the current load) to
provide the desired benefit of faster rendering.</li>
</ol>

<p>Sorry to all. Nonetheless, we'll continue to try to test this parameter.
Some worlds are still using it, and it may actually provide a benefit in
the future. We shall see.</p>

<h4>Viewpoints</h4>

<p>Terra Vista zones usually incorporate a list of cameras in the segment
file, usually accessed in a browsers as &quot;views&quot; or &quot;viewpoints.&quot;
The viewpoints list provides a method for navigating directly to a given
point (like a person's inlined home or a navigation device, or even a map
view of the entire segment.</p>

<p>This list is often available as a popup, and some browsers provide a
button for toggling your way through the list. Some browsers don't provide
the list at all. Our tests report whether the viewpoints are accessible,
how they are accessed, and whether the feature worked.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>Often what is revealed in these tests is not so much inaccuracy in browsers
as variability between browsers. Or, inaccuracies in the testbed worlds.
At times the reports may seem tentative as if (and this <i>is</i> the case)
the reporter is unsure of where to place the &quot;blame&quot; for an anomaly.
Well, it is dangerous to leap to conclusions. The reporters are not experts
in VRML. All of the experts have better things to do right now, like crafting
the next standard and writing browsers.</p>

<p>One warning to authors: test your creations in more than one browser.
Doing so will help you and perhaps us to discern differences in implementation
from outright improper implementation of the VRML 1.0 specs. You will also
get a better idea of what visitors to your site may see. If you have a
particular effect in mind, you ought to find out what that effect looks
like through different viewers. Remember that everytime you specify that
your site is &quot;best viewed with . . .&quot; you tell a certain number
of visitors not to bother to come to your site. Is that the effect you
want to have?</p>

<h3><a name="WorldView"></a>WorldView 1.0 Beta 1, Intervista </h3>

<p>WorldView works as a standalone browser or as a plug-in with an HTML
browser. If you use it as a standalone, it will automatically launch your
default web browser when you link to an HTML file. It uses the Reality
Labs rendering engine, now owned by Microsoft, so scenes will look similar
to those rendered with the MSIE 2.0 VRML Add-In and other browsers using
Reality Labs.</p>

<h4>Notable Features</h4>

<p>WorldView has a command in the file menu called Edit Source. When you
select this command, the program launches Notepad and opens the source
code in it.</p>

<p>It also allows you to change the timeout duration for the browser. One
drawback of some browsers is that when a timeout period ends, the browser
simply says &quot;I'm done.&quot; It doesn't tell you that it timed out.
As a result, you have no idea if the world has rendered correctly. WorldView
lets you set the timeout durations. I set mine for 600 seconds, since internet
traffic can be hairy these days. The default of 60 seconds is a bit short
and it was frustrating as I tried over and over to load a world only to
have the browser say &quot;done&quot; without actually doing anything.</p>

<h4>Speed</h4>

<p>The rendering speed was satisfactory. This was true for all the browsers
we tested.</p>

<h4>Accuracy</h4>

<p>The browser seems to accurately depict the scenes with a couple of minor
exceptions to report.</p>

<p>The ascii text on some objects &quot;leaked&quot; off the edges. This
can't be really called an inaccuracy, since it did render the text centered
on the object, just as it was coded to do. The default spacing of the text
was simply too wide to fit on to the objects. </p>

<p>One other problem I noticed (and I don't know if it was the code or
this browser) was that a cube that I believe should have been rendered
transparent came out cement gray instead. It is in the first segment of
New George Town. The VRML in question is an inline with LOD. At entry,
the object appears to be a green cube floating above the ground. As you
approach, it should become three hovering inverted cones over a blue pool.
WorldView rendered a big gray cube at the highest level of detail, but
I believe the cube is supposed to be transparent and serves as the anchor
object for a link to the Air Link Zone. When viewed in Live3D, the cube
<i>does</i> appear transparent. Note: this is a good example of why it
is desirable for authors to test worlds in more than one browser.</p>

<h4>LOD</h4>

<p>The browser seems to render LOD correctly. WorldView allows you to set
the LOD to always be at the highest level, so that LOD never changes. If
the use of LOD is intended to reduce the rendering load for the browser,
this will defeat the purpose, but at least the scene will be rendered properly.</p>

<p>You can also select lower levels of detail, either overall or when moving.
This is a nice feature, especially in big worlds or on slow machines.</p>

<h4>Viewpoints</h4>

<p>WorldView provides a very short list of viewpoints, apparently just
the first defined camera and a default camera that is located some distance
from the scene. The viewpoint is accessed in a popup menu or from the pulldowns.
WorldView will allow you to define a camera within a scene you have loaded.
It does not insert this camera into the scene code that is available from
the file menu, so you can't use it as a quick way to write camera code.</p>

<p><a href="#Top">Return to the Top</a>

<h3><a name="Cybergate"></a>CyberGate Beta 3, Black Sun</h3>

<p>Cybergate is unusual among VRML 1.0 browsers because it permits multi-user
experiences, with moving avatars to represent other people in the world.
It is capable of browsing in both standard VRML 1.0 worlds and multi-user
worlds. The extensions which permit Black Sun's multi-user feature fit
within the VRML 1.0 standard and may eventually be added to Terra Vista
worlds.</p>

<p>Testing using Beta 3 of CyberGate worked just fine. Previous tests were
problematic for undiscovered reasons. I simply typed the test world URL
into the browser, hit return, and entered. Note that the prototype world
in the test is not a multi-user world. Multi-user worlds require an additional
server which manages the multi-user aspects of the experience. </p>

<h4>Notable Features</h4>

<p>CyberGate's interface includes many options. One is a message list that
reports problems during the loading of a world. There were several that
occurred during the test, and the zone owner of the prototype is investigating
them. This list may prove helpful for developers who want to test their
code before posting it to the web.</p>

<h4>Speed</h4>

<p>The speed of the CyberGate browser is good. If you use it in the Point
World or other multi-user space, this may not be immediately apparent as
the browser (in my experience) sometimes bogs down in dealing with updates--accounting
for the positions and activities of other users. This is the problem we
generally refer to as &quot;latency.&quot; Latency also shows up when trying
to chat with other users: it can take an uncomfortable amount of time for
messages to get to the recipient. Try the browser in a world without multiple
users and you will find it renders just fine.</p>

<h4>Accuracy</h4>

<p>For the most part, CyberGate renders scenes accurately. I noticed the
following two anomalies:</p>

<p>Curiously, the blue sky background of the test world was rendered a
sort of steely gray, as if the world was overcast and gloomy. Other browsers
tested rendered the same scene with a blue sky, and a bit brighter as well.</p>

<p>Also, ascii text did not seem to be centered on signs. Instead, it seemed
to start at the center of the sign.</p>

<h4>LOD</h4>

<p>To the best of our knowledge, this beta version of CyberGate has not
yet implemented LOD. Objects with LOD appear at one level of detail, regardless
of distance. In one case, this turned out to be the highest detail, in
another case, the lowest.</p>

<h4>Viewpoints</h4>

<p>As near as we can tell, this beta of CyberGate also does not include
a viewpoints list. The scene opens at the entry view camera point, but
other viewpoints (or a way to access them) could not be found. CyberGate
<i>does</i> provide multiple views of the same scene (including a top view).
By placing the pointer in the top view scene, you can drive around in the
second view.</p>

<h4>Oddities</h4>

<p>During the test, I did experience some navigation irregularities, in
which I essentially was teleported to a distant point. This happened when
I single clicked on a WWWAnchor (a sign in New George Town). Double clicking
on the anchor caused it to work correctly.</p>

<h3><a name="Live3D"></a>Live3D Beta 2, Netscape Communications </h3>

<p>Netscape's newest version of Navigator (also called Atlas) includes
several plug-ins, including Live3D's latest beta. Live3D is also now available
for the Mac OS (although we haven't tested it on that platform yet).</p>

<h4>Notable Features</h4>

<p>Live 3D has added some new features and made moderate changes to the
interface. Rendering shading has also been improved; some users complained
that when WebFX became Live3D, the rendering actually became poorer. Earlier,
we reported that the rendering for Live3D was not as nice as the browsers
using Reality Labs, but Beta 2's rendering was good and fast in the test.</p>

<ul>
<li>New: adjustable headlight intensity, available in the control bar or
the popup menu. 
<br></li>

<li>Viewpoints control in the display: click on the up and down arrows
of the view control to advance to the next viewpoint in the camera list.
The viewpoint list remains accessible by right click popup menu too. 
<br></li>

<li>Navigation commands include a straighten command. In the test, it functioned
the same as selecting the current viewpoint-returning your POV to the currently
selected camera. 
<br></li>

<li>The browser animates between view points and clicks. As I recall, this
feature was in Beta 1, too. 
<br></li>

<li>There is also a stay on ground option for walking navigation. Unfortunately,
this is not yet a true terrain following feature. If you turn the collision
detection, you will stop when you reach an obstacle (even an inclined plane)
rather than &quot;walking over it.&quot; Likewise, if you turn collision
detection off, you will stay on the same level and &quot;wade&quot; through
any objects you encounter. VRealm's browser DOES have a terrain following
&quot;stay on ground&quot; option, though. 
<br></li>

<li>And finally: Netscape did not bomb Win95 on exit after the test session.
Say goodbye to the illegal operation message. Thanks, Paper! That was getting
old.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Speed</h4>

<p>Live3D's speed is adequate, like all the browsers tested in this batch.
I could have taken the time to find out which was fastest, but I just don't
care enough to do so. What am I going to find? Browser x was 2 seconds
faster than browser y? If you can't spare those two seconds, you're too
busy to be bopping around on the web, especially with todays crawling download
speeds.</p>

<h4>Accuracy</h4>

<p>It's actually a little unfair to remark on the accuracy of Live3D because
it is the browser that most authors &quot;write to&quot;, at least to the
extent that writing to browsers is done. What I mean is that it is the
most popular browser, so authors test their worlds in Live3D first. If
things look off at that point, they correct them. Do they proceed to test
with other browsers to find variations? Some probably do, others likely
do not. And after rambling on for a minute, the reporter was finally heard
to remark: Live3D rendered everything we saw accurately.</p>

<h4>LOD</h4>

<p>Based on the tests, Live3D now renders the LOD of inlined worlds correctly.</p>

<h4>Viewpoints</h4>

<p>Live3D includes all of the cameras for the world in a viewpoints list.
The list is available via popup menu (right click) or with the new views
control on the control bar. You can toggle forward or backward in the viewpoint
list. This is actually a nifty feature because if the author constructs
the list correctly, you can take a little &quot;guided tour&quot; of a
world by clicking on viewpoints and animating between them.</p>

<p><a href="#Top">Return to the Top</a> 
<hr></p>

<h3><a name="MSIE"></a>Microsoft Internet Explorer 2.0 with VRML Add In
2.0 </h3>

<p>Finished my world test with MSIE with VRML Add-In 2.0. Note, this only
works with Win 95 at this time. MSIE 2.0 is available for mac, but to my
knowledge, VRML add-in is not. This is not a viable option for folks with
low end machines running Win 3.x or people not running Windows. </p>

<h4>Notable Features</h4>

<p>It was noted in a previous version of these reports that VRML Add In
and WorldView look very similar, except that VRML Add In seems to have
fewer features (with one exception, see below). Well, check the about box
for this software (from the pop up) and you will see why: it IS a version
of WorldView with fewer features. Intervista wrote this package and licensed
it to Microsoft.</p>

<h4>Speed</h4>

<p>VRML Add In 2.0 is about as fast as the other browsers were in the tests
we ran. Having written this sentence or one like it four times now, I wonder
if it even makes sense to evaluate the speed of browsers without sophisticated
measurement tests.</p>

<h4>Accuracy</h4>

<p>VRML Add In is mostly accurate. Like WorldView, it renders worlds a
little brighter. Some items which appear with light pastel colors in Live3D
appear gray. Some boxes which appear transparent in Live3D appear gray.</p>

<p>One of the inlines disappeared during viewing. It was one that included
LOD, I think. I was bopping around and it was there a second ago, then
bam! it wasn't.</p>

<p>Some of the worlds I loaded came through very strangely: sort of like
only a thin slice of the world was visible. Hard to explain what this looked
like. You should try it yourself. Get VRML Add In 2.0 and point it at </p>

<center><p><tt>http://www.co.umist.ac.uk/~georgep/tv/na0.wrl</tt></p></center>

<p>The first world loads oddly, but seems to resolve itself if you select
the entrance view from the viewpoints list. Link to one of the other worlds
for the unusual effects.</p>

<h4>LOD</h4>

<p>I'm not certain, but I believe that this browser renders the LOD of
inlines incorrectly. It behaved itself for one of the tests and then exhibited
the bug for one of the others (New George Town segments 1 and 2 respectively).
In earlier tests it exhibited the incorrect behavior and I don't believe
this version has changed.</p>

<h4>Viewpoints</h4>

<p>This is the one feature that VRML Add-In has that WorldView does not:
it DOES provide you with a complete list of the viewpoints for the VRML
file. They are available in the pop up (right click on the screen area).</p>

<p><a href="#Top">Return to the Top</a> 
<hr></p>
<h3><a name="VRScout"></a>VRScout Beta 1.22, Chaco</h3>

<p align=center>This review is done by John C. von Rosen, not David George.</p>

<p>This is another browser that doesn't seem to have many bugs, and it sticks
to the spec pretty well. Navigation was intuitive, and the minor additions
to navigation were helpful.</p>

<h4>Notable Features</h4>
<p>Note - I did not experiment with any non VRML 1.0 extensions.</p>
<ul><li>It kept the descriptions for the WWWAnchors out of the view screen.
<li>While walking, it draws a line on the screen to show the direction you're
walking. If you'd rather not see the line, you can turn it off.
<li>Not a feature, more a lack thereof: no status bar or window while loading. 
I like to see a little bar graph
that will at least approximate how much longer I have to wait.
</ul>

<h4>Speed</h4>

<p>VRScout seemed to render everything at
a speed similar to other browsers until I loaded a semi-complex world. This
world (GeorgeTown) was dispayed by most browsers within 30 seconds, but under
VRScout, I gave up after almost ten minutes of waiting. I tried this over the
internet and locally, with the same result. This problem with loading 
complex worlds was also evident on the Pentium/133 with 16 Meg.</p>

<h4>Accuracy</h4>

<p>VRScout followed the VRML 1.0 spec to a 'T' as far as I could tell. The
only thing that I'd consider to be inaccurate is shading... the cylinders in
my log cabin seemed to bleed together. However, this isn't really an issue
with specification compliance, rather personal taste.</p>

<h4>LOD</h4>

<p>VRScout is another browser that implements LOD correctly.</p>

<h4>Viewpoints</h4>

<p>I couldn't figure out how to switch between pre-defined camera views, so I
assume this is not yet supported by VRScout. However, there is always an option
to reset the camera view to the entrance view. From what I understand, Chaco
will include viewpoints in their next release of VRScout.

<p><a href="#Top">Return to the Top</a> 
<hr></p>

<h3><a name="VRealm"></a>VRealm, IDS </h3>

<p align=center>This review is done by John C. von Rosen, not David George.</p>
<p>Word got around that VRealm from IDS did not have the same LOD problem
that was found in other browsers, so I had to try it out. Overall, I was very
impressed with VRealm, however, it is not a low-end browser.  I tested it on
a Compaq Deskpro 486/66 with 8 Meg, and it was slower than most browsers. It
did run, and speed was acceptable, however I'd recommend a minimum of 12 Meg for
comfortable viewing. 

<h4>Notable Features</h4>

<p>Note - I did not experiment with any non VRML 1.0 extensions.</p>
<ul><li>I really liked the Navigational Pads.  It helped me keep my bearings straight 
while viewing. I'd like to see these developed even further, perhaps a
representation of objects in the movement pad to make a sort of overhead view.
<li>VRealm keeps a list of predefined and user-defined camera views... if
you're walking around and you catch a good view, you can save it for later.
<li>Colors are outstanding. Absolutely perfect. If your system can support
16 bit color, VRealm will take advantage of it.  The shading is much more
realistic than other browsers I have used.
</ul>

<h4>Speed</h4>

<p>VRealm is a little slower than most other browsers, which I suspect has
something to do with supporting 64K colors and the navigational pads.  Since
this was tested on a 486/66 with 8 Meg, I'm sure the speed issue would be
less evident on faster machines.</p>

<h4>Accuracy</h4>

<p>Everything appeared to be completely compliant with VRML 1.0, with one
minor exception: VRealm seems to miss the description field in the WWWAnchor node. 
When my cursor passed over an anchor, the name showed up instead of the
description. One thing that should be noted in VRealm's favor is that the
shading and colors appear to be much more realistic.</p>

<h4>LOD</h4>

<p>As far as I could tell, VRealm was 100% compliant with the VRML spec in 
this regard.

<h4>Viewpoints</h4>

<p>VRealm has a feature that some other browsers have: in addition to being
able to switch between predefined camera views, the user can define their own
views if they find an interesting one.</p>
