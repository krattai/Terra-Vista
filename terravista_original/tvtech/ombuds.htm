<p>Finally, the Ombudsman Committee has been chosen.  This committee is
designed to serve the Terra Vista Community in the event that the residents
and builders of Terra Vista are unable to reach a consensus during the
development and maintainance of the community.  Their various backgrounds and
the respect for their work and their opinions has led the members of the 
community to elect them to this position. The committee, in alphabetical order:
<ul>
<li><a href="mailto:adamgru@well.com">Adam Gruen</a> -<br>
Dr. Adam Gruen is the author of <a href="http://www.well.com/user/adamgru/vCity">vCity 1.0</a>, 
first conceptualized long before Terra Vista was born.  Adam has contributed to
the community before it existed with the insight and vision he has displayed
in this book.<ul><li>
<a href="adam.htm">Adam's Credentials</a></ul>
<br>
<li><a href="mailto:broehl@coulomb.uwaterloo.ca">Bernie Roehl</a> -<br>
Bernie needs no introduction to many of the members of Terra Vista.  He is an
old-timer in the VRML community, and contributes to the growth of VRML with
his writings. The experience and understanding he brings to Terra Vista will
ensure the growth of this project.
<ul><li><a href="bernie.htm">Bernie's Credentials</a></ul>
<br>
<li><a href="mailto:g.philippakos@stud.umist.ac.uk">George Philippakos</a> -<br>
If anyone can be called the founder of Terra Vista, it would be George. His
suggestion to the VRML mailing list on March 25, 1996, entitled "g-zip inlines
and some crazy thoughts" will live forever as the foundation for the world we
now live in. Since that time, George has kept the vision alive.

<br>
<li><a href="mailto:jeffs@ncgate.newcollege.edu">Jeff Sonstein</a> -<br>
Jeff is another old-timer in the VRML community ("since before there were
browsers" in his own words), and has also contributed his writings to support
the development of VRML. His
experience in the computer industry and dedication to VRML has earned him the
deserved respect in the VRML community and in Terra Vista.

<br>
<li><a href="mailto:krattai@escape.ca">Kevin Rattai</a> -<br>
Kevin could be refered to as the one who has organized and rallied us together
for the creation of this community. He has been extremely active in the design
of Terra Vista from it's conception, and has made sure to involve everyone
who is interrested. Kevin's dedication to Terra Vista is evident to all members
of the community.
