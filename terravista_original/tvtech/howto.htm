<h3>
<hr width="100%" >Notes to reviewers of this draft:</h3>

<p>Since this is the first technical draft, the review instructions are
a bit extensive. They will eventually move to a separate document, but
for now, here they are. BTW: feel free to comment on anything, including
the instructions to reviewers.</p>

<p>This draft is the first, rough version of a HowTo for tvWorld
construction.
I am soliciting comments in general and in specific:</p>

<h4>Format:</h4>

<ul>
<li>The strategy is to provide enabling knowledge (prereq's, tools list,
objectives, etc.) then break down procedures following. This is somewhat
less rigorous than what I'd do in an industrial training environment, but
the tasks are different. The procedures are also less rigorous than my
custom, but I've tried to focus the steps on actions and to keep the whys
and wherefores in the enabling knowledge section.</li>

<li>I've pitched low and slow--for newbies. For experts, there is a
requirements
summary, all they really need. That said, I've tried to keep the focus
on tvWorld construction, not general VRML stuff. Answer: go buy a book.
Support our author friends. They've done it better than I can and they
deserve some support.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Technical Veracity:</h4>

<ul>
<li>This is a first blush, based on early experience. It <b>may</b> be
(I'm such an optimist!) out of date or inaccurate. I'm expecting two types
of errors to occur, and if you can correct me within these guidelines,
it will help:</li>

<ul>
<li>First, the VRML or the instructions may be incorrect. Good intent,
bad execution. Please provide proper execution and code examples in your
remarks. Note: the code example is based on a file template George P
posted
weeks back. Any changes made were either to edit his comments or to add
stuff. I used the VRML Sourcebook, but I'm no expert. If you want to refer
me to info in that book please do. I haven't finished reading it yet, but
I find it to be an excellent resource.</li>

<li>Second, the tvWorld file structure may be incorrect. Example: I
noticed
a midrange LOD in some worlds, if this is being used, good, but if not,
we can strip it out. This is where I expect most debate to occur as we
wrestle with what is required, what is optional.</li>
</ul>

<li>I recommend that remarks on bad VRML be posted directly to me to keep
list traffic down. However, as the tvWorld structure debate should be
public.
Post to a thread there (&quot;tvWorld Structure&quot; or some such).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Writing Style:</h4>

<ul>
<li>I'm a writer and editor--I live by the red pen, so it may be wielded
against me in return. You can't hurt my feelings by editing my words
unless
you do so in a ham-handed and abusive way. (&quot;Stupid&quot; is a word
you should leave out of any editing remarks). If I've been unclear,
verbose,
etc. point it out. This is a first draft, and this is the time to make
such remarks. If you have alternative wording or feel that critical
details
or emphasis has been left out, please add it in.</li>

<li>Likewise, as I receive remarks from people, I'll probably edit them
as I incorporate them. If the emphasis or intent is lost, redirect me.
If I failed to write it exactly as you told me verbatim, well, that's
life.
The intent is to transmit information to users, as quickly and painlessly
as possible. If that occurs, then this document is a success. Beautiful
prose is for creative writers--not the mission here.</li>
</ul>

<p>Without further ado, the draft follows:</p>

<h3><a name="Prereq"></a>Prerequisites: What You Should Already Know </h3>

<p>
<hr width="100%"></p>

<p>This file is written to help new users construct a home file that can
be added to a Terra Vista zone. If you are already expert in VRML
construction,
you may want to skip to the <a
href="#ReqSumm">Requirements
Summary</a>. You may also want to look over the <a
href="#Structure">Basic
Terra Vista Home File Structure</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a newbie, unfortunately this <b><i>How To</i></b> will not
teach you everything that you need to know to build VRML files. It <i>will
</i>explain the required elements of a Terra Vista home world and sketch
out a suggested file structure, but you should already be able to build
basic VRML files. If you need help in learning to build VRML, there are
many good books and other resources available. The <a
href="http://www.sdsc.edu/vrml">VRML
Repository</a> at SDSC maintains a list you may refer to. </p>

<h3><a name="Tools"></a>Tools and Reources: </h3>

<p>
<hr width="100%"></p>

<p>In order to build and provide your home world to the Terra Vista
Community,
you will need the following: </p>

<ul>
<li>A computer is required.--if you're reading this, we'll assume you have
one or have access to one. </li>

<p>What kind of computer do you need? Most VRML browsing and building
software
works best on faster machines--Pentium or comparable CPUs are recommended,
and 486DX2 or comparable CPUs are considered minimally capable. You should
consider a math co-processor mandatory. 16 Megabytes of RAM will also
help,
but it is possible to get by with 8. </p>

<p>Which operating system should you have? Most of the software is
available
in versions compatible with Windows 95, Windows NT, or Windows 3.1. Some
software is also available in Unix compatible versions, including Linux
versions. Recently, more VRML software is also available in Mac OS
versions.
If you need help finding software, visit the <a
href="http://www.sdsc.edu/vrml">VRML
Repository</a>, which maintains a link list for VRML software. </p>

<li>Some software is required. </li>

<p>The minimum software required is some type of text editor capable of
saving files in ASCII text format. This will at least allow you to
construct
your VRML code file, which is an ASCII text file. </p>

<p>Although it is possible to construct your home with only a text editor,
a VRML 1.0 (or 2.0) browser will enable you to view the world you create. Many are
available, and several can be obtained over the WWW at no cost on a trial
basis. If you need help finding a browser, check the <a
href="http://www.sdsc.edu/vrml">VRML
Repository</a>, which maintains a nice link list of browsers. </p>

<p>Several VRML authoring packages are available. Due to the size
limitations
and other requirements of Terra Vista home worlds, we recommend that you
use a package that builds VRML 1.x or VRML 2.0 compliant files and which also uses
primitives. Some authoring packages use indexed face sets rather than
primitives.
The resulting files are usually too large to meet the Terra Vista size
requirements. </p>

<li>Space on a web server is required. </li>

<p>Your world will be inlined into a Terra Vista zone. This means that
the zone file will have a node that looks for the URL of your home file
and fetches the file whenever the zone is loaded by a visitor. You must
find some type of web server to serve your file to the zone and provide
the URL for your world. </p>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Objectives"></a>Objectives: </h3>

<p>
<hr width="100%"></p>

<p>The objective of this <b><i>How To</i></b> is to help you build a VRML
file that represents your tastes and personality and which meets the Terra
Vista home requirements. There are also a few options you may wish to add.
We leave the expression of your personality to you. The requirements and
options are described below. </p>

<h4>Requirements </h4>

<ul>
<li>Limited file size. Your file must not be larger than 3 kilobytes in
size, including inlined components. </li>

<p>You may link the inlined home world to a different VRML file located
at your site and outside the community. Your files may be any size you
like. The upper limit applies only to the inlined world you place in a
Terra Vista zone. Why must the files be so small? Each segment (the space
in a zone your home shares with other homes) must be able to load on a
visitor's browser in a reasonable amount of time. It should also display
reasonably well. One of the ways to assure this is limiting the file size.
The segment file itself is already small. The homes must also be small.
</p>

<li>Your file must strictly conform to either the VRML 1.x or VRML 2.0 standards. No
non-standard
fields or extensions are permitted. </li>

<p><b><i>NOTE:</i></b> There are special extensions that do comply with
the VRML standards. See the OnLive! and Black Sun <b><i>How
To's</i></b>
on adding their extensions to a zone. You don't need to worry about these
extensions in your home files. </p>

<li>Your inlined home world must have at least two levels of detail (LOD).
</li>

<p>From a distance of 60 meters or more, only a cube is visible.
Optionally,
you may add a mid-range level of detail that is visible when the viewer
is between 60 and 40 meters from your home. Your home should become
completely
visible within a range of 40. </p>

<li>Your world volume is limited. The zone you build in will define volume
limits for your home. </li>

<p>Like the file size limits, the volume limits apply only within the
Terra
Vista zones. Files linked to from your home that are outside the zone may
be any volume you like. </p>

<li>The zone you build in may also define aesthetic design guidelines or
requirements for your home. </li>

<p>There are a variety of zones available to different tastes, from the
realistic to the bizarre. If you can't find a zone that meets your
exacting
standards, you can always start a zone of your own. </p>
</ul>

<h4>Options</h4>

<p>Here are a couple of options you may wish to include in your homeworld.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Provide a link to your home page or another place. </li>

<p>Most Terra Vista homeworlds include at least one link that usually goes
to the home owners HTML homepage. It could also link to a more detailed
version of your home. The link is executed by adding a WWWAnchor node to
the highest level of detail in your home. No links should be available
at the lower levels of detail. You may add as many links as you like, just
as long as your home world file is within the size limits. </p>

<li>Add a Mailbox. </li>

<p>Most Terra Vista homeowners also include a mailbox. A mailbox is simply
a WWWAnchor node with a <tt>mailto</tt> link in it. It works just like
the <tt>mailto</tt> links in HTML. If someone clicks on your mailbox, your
email package will automatically launch. An example of the mailbox code
is included in the Basic File Structure section. </p>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Structure"></a>Basic Terra Vista Home File Structure </h3>

<p>
<hr width="100%"></p>

<p>The basic file structure for a home world file is shown between the
horizontal rules below. You may want to paste this file into a text file
as the template for your homeworld.</p>

<h3><a name="Steps"></a>Home World Construction Steps </h3>

<p>
<hr width="100%"></p>

<p>NOTE: It may help if you copy the basic file structure (section above)
into a text file first. You can use it as a starting template for your
Terra Vista home world. Don't forget to name the file with the .wrl
extension.</p>

<h4>Adding Your Home Details </h4>

<ol>
<li>Insert the code for the detailed version of your home world inside
the <tt>DEF CloseUp Separator</tt> node, beginning below the line:</li>

<pre><tt>#Insert your detailed home code here</tt></pre>

<li>Note: don't add your link and mailbox objects in this space. They must
be included in the WWWAnchor nodes, as noted below. Alternately, you may
build the objects of your world (inlcuding links and mailboxes) until all
looks the way you want it and then move the WWWAnchor code to this section
to make the objects into active links.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>DO NOT</b> place WWWAnchor nodes outside of the <tt>DEF CloseUp
Separator</tt> node, please.</li>
</ul>
</ol>

<h4>Adding Your Link(s) </h4>

<ol>
<li>If you are including a link, insert the URL for your link in the
<tt>name</tt>
field of the WWWAnchor node. </li>

<ul>
<li>If you are not including a link, you can either comment the link code
out (by putting a # at the start of each line) or delete it. Deletion is
preferable, since this will reduce your file size. </li>
</ul>

<li>Enter the text you want to appear when the pointer is over the link
in the <tt>description</tt> field. </li>

<li>Enter the code for the linking object below it. </li>

<ul>
<li>Simple example: if your link will be a welcome mat on the doorstep
of your home, add the necessary code to position and create the welcome
mat within the WWWAnchor node. In this respect, it functions just like
a separator, grouping the objects together. All objects inside the
WWWAnchor
node will behave like links. </li>
</ul>

<li>Test your link. Open your homeworld as a local file in your browser
and see if the link object appears and behaves like a link. </li>

<ul>
<li>Does the object appear? </li>

<li>Does it behave like a link? Different browsers work with links in
different
ways. Commonly, the cursor or pointer will change when it is over a link,
and the description will appear somewhere (like in the status bar or in
the field of view). </li>

<li>Does it link to the URL you designated? Click on it and see. </li>
</ul>

<li>If you want to add another link, copy the next WWWAnchor node below
the first one and repeat the steps above. You may want to use different
DEF names for each link. </li>
</ol>

<h4>Adding Your Mailbox </h4>

<ol>
<li>If you are including a mailbox, insert your email address in the
mailbox
WWWAnchor node. Insert your email in place of the text:</li>

<pre><tt>you@yourmail.address</tt></pre>

<ul>
<li>If you are not including a mailbox, you can either comment the code
out (with a # sign at the start of each line) or delete it. Deletion is
preferred, since every character in your file increases its size. </li>
</ul>

<li>Enter the VRML code that defines what your mailbox will look like
inside
the WWWAnchor node for the mailbox. Insert this code below the line:</li>

<pre><tt>#Insert code for the mailbox object here</tt></pre>

<li>Test your mailbox. Load your home file as a local file in your browser
and see if the mailbox appears and works. </li>

<ul>
<li>Does your browser respond to the mailbox as if it is a link? Does the
description appear? Does the cursor change? Different browsers respond
to WWWAnchors differently. If yours does not respond correctly, check your
code to be sure you have written the WWWAnchor correctly. </li>

<li>Does your browser open your mail package when you click on the
mailbox?
If the browser treats the mailbox as a link but does not automatically
launch your email program, check your code to be sure the mailto code is
correct. Check your browser by clicking on other mailboxes in a Terra
Vista
zone. If your browser won't launch the mail program for other mailboxes,
check to see that it is configured correctly. </li>

<li>Also, be sure that the email address that appears in the <tt>To:</tt>
field in the email program is your correct address. </li>
</ul>
</ol>

<h4>Adding Lower Levels of Detail </h4>

<ol>
<li>If you are including a medium level of detail, insert the code for
your medium detail home world below the MidRange Separator node. Insert
the code below the line:</li>

<pre><tt>#Insert your mid range home code here</tt></pre>

<ul>
<li>NOTE: You should not include any WWWAnchors in this node.</li>

<li>ALSO: If you are not specifying a mid-range level of detail, either
comment the code out with a # at the start of each line or delete the
code.
Deletion is preferred.</li>
</ul>

<li>Define the color for the lowest level of detail</li>

<li>Size the cube for the lowest level of detail</li>

<li>Test your levels of detail. Load your home file as a local file and
walk towards or away from it. Do the levels of detail change as you move
nearer or farther?</li>
</ol>

<h4>Check the File Size</h4>

<p>Okay, so you've built this fabulous world, it looks stunning and it's
only 30 K. Ooops! That's about 10 times the size you are allowed. The best
time to check your file size is as you build the world, but you should
certainly make a last check before you try to add the world.</p>

<ol>
<li>Check the size of your .wrl file and all files (like texture bitmaps)
that are included. The total size must be 3K or under.</li>

<li>Try gzipping your world to see if that gets it into the size
requirements.
Using gzip is explained elsewhere.</li>

<li>Save your source under a different filename and then go into your
world
and strip out comments and commented-out code that is not used. These
notes
are helpful when you are building, so keeping them in a source file will
retain them.</li>

<li>It is highly recommended that you use primitives wherever possible
and avoid large indexed face sets. Some VRML authoring software (like
Caligari
Fountain/Pioneer/Crusader) does not use primitives--if you put a sphere
in your world, it puts in a large indexed face set, not a sphere
node.</li>

<li>If all else fails, something has got to go. You may wish to do away
with the entire mid-range separator node. In this case, be sure to modify
the LOD to include only one distance, not two.</li>

<ul>
<li>Change the LOD node distances from:</li>

<p><tt>DEF Details LOD { range [ 40, 60 ]</tt></p>

<li>To:</li>

<p><tt>DEF Details LOD { range [ 60 ]</tt></p>

<li>Cut the midrange separator by deleting (inclusively) from :</li>

<p><tt>DEF MidRange Separator {</tt></p>

<li>To:</li>

<p><tt>#End of mid range details 
<br>}</tt></p>

<li>If the file is still too large, you will have to start taking out
details.
Remember that extra lines and blank space don't really add to the file
size--it's all those pesky characters. Refer to a good VRML building
resource
for pointers on how to make your code smaller.</li>
</ul>

<li>Think of your inlined world as a doorway, not a complete world. It
places you in the community. You can always place the beautiful and highly
detailed version of your home on your server--indeed, you are requested
to do so! We all want to see your work. In the glorious future of ATM or
ADSL or Cable Modems or (insert fast connection name here), bandwidth will
not be a problem. This is not the case today, though, so we must limit
ourselves to 3K worlds so that the entire segment loads before
dinner.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Ready to Add Your World?</h4>

<ol>
<li>If you've tested your world and it meets the requirements for a Terra
Vista homeworld, then you should upload it to the web server you will be
serving it from.</li>

<li>Once you've uploaded the file, you should try downloading it via the
web, just to be sure that the server is correctly configured to serve
VRML.</li>

<ul>
<li>If the file downloads as text rather than a virtual world, you may
have a problem. First, be sure it is the web server and not your browser
that is the problem. Talk to your service provider and/or consult the
<b><i>HowTo</i></b>
on configuring web servers to serve VRML.</li>
</ul>

<li>If your home zone has any design requirements, you must work out
acceptance
of your home with the owner of the zone.</li>

<li>Provide the URL for your home to the zone owner. (Each zone has its
own way of performing this function.) That's it. Once the zone owner
modifies
the zone to inline your world, it should appear whenever the world is
loaded.
Once you know it is inlined, go to the segment and see how it looks in
place.</li>

<li>You may want to modify your world once you have it in place. Make sure
that when you make changes that your new world works at least as well as
the old one before you replace the old one. Then, upload the modified
file.
Be sure the new version has the EXACT SAME URL as the original.</li>

<li>That's it. Welcome to Terra Vista!</li>
