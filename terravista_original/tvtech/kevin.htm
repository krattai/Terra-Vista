As we approach the velection of the vOmbudsman, I offer myself to the voting
populace:

I am Kevin Rattai from Beausejour, MB, CA.  I am an independant computer
analyst/programmer by training, I am a VR enthusiast by design.

My roots in the VR community are deep.  I became a proponent and student of
Human/Computer Interaction and Useability in 1979 with a letter to
Intellivision (one of the first North American CGA home entertainment
makers, aside from Atari) stating that they might have something that would
really make people notice them if they were to give the player a 'first
person' viewpoint.  (btw, they wrote back saying, "thanks, we have people
doing that type of research").  The rest is history.  I started writing ray
tracers, CAD/3D modelling, simulation, and user interface software in 1989
because I couldn't find anything that _really_ fit my needs.  In 1992 I
heard about VR while at a User Interface Stratagies Seminar, read about it
in a book by Howard Rheingold "Virtual Reality", and haven't slept since.
I've maintained close relationships with Tony Havelka of Liquid Image
(they're local) and Karen August of VRASP since the beginning of 1993.  I
became involved in VRML after doing a search of VR on some webcrawlers back
in October of 1995.

I am interested in being on the committee because I believe the technology
is more than ready to be placed into the publics hands.  As this community
grows, there will be issues that may not be able to be resolved.  At that
time, those of the committee need to take a holistic view of the issue and
consider the implications for now and into the future.  I believe that I am
quite capable to perform those duties.  I do not believe that the committee
should be a governing body.  It should be an Ombudsman, to resolve
conflicts.  As well, it should be a guiding light as to where this project
may lead to in 6 months, 1 year, and 5 years.

Thank you for listening,

Kevin
